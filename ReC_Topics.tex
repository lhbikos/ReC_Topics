\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{PREFACE}

\textbf{If you are viewing this document, you should know that this is a book-in-progress. Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 24 Aug 2021}

\textbf{There are lectures accompanying each lesson. At present, these screencast of these lectures are from prior lecture notes and not directly from this OER. While the content should be parallel, you might find it to be somewhat discordant. I do plan to relecture these using the formatting of the OER; I just can't get to it this year. Please accept my apologies.}

\href{https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c932455e-ef06-444a-bdca-acf7012d759a}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

To \emph{center} a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy -- that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., \emph{psych}, \emph{lavaan}) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub respository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license {[}CC BY-NC-SA 4.0{]}.

Training models for doctoral programs in HSP are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the \emph{scientist-practitioner-advocacy} training model incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities \citep{mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014}. In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field's \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive?

In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC{[}low-middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity,
\item
  the lesson's statistic is used in the article, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available.
\end{itemize}

In training for multicultural competence, the saying, ``A fish doesn't know that it's wet'' is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our systems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to \emph{changing the water} in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-2005), I learned that ``a foreign language'' was required for graduation. \emph{Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English.} This could have been met with credit from high school my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program -- but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouri's School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (fortran, C++) -- I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, ``SPSS for Windows'' would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook \citep{green_using_2014} that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (2947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine was Dr.~Barbara Byrne's \citeyearpar{byrne_structural_2016}, ``Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS.'' I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it (a little catfur might have fallen out). Dr.~Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr.~Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr.~Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials.

The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the \href{https://www.academics4blacklives.com/}{Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative}. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology.

At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU's Library, and more specifically, SPU's Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics \& Illustrations, Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover. Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr.~Jhangiani's text \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation.

\hypertarget{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}{%
\section{What to expect in each chapter}\label{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}}

This textbook is intended as \emph{applied,} in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and \emph{writing them up} for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator).

This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, \emph{hand-calculations} (only we calculate them arithmetically in R) to provide a \emph{visceral feeling} of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic. Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a \emph{workflow} through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses.

As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a \emph{research vignette.} Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article,
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC {[}low middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and
\item
  the data is available in a repository or there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s).
\end{itemize}

In each chapter we employ \emph{R} packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science.

\hypertarget{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}{%
\section{Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER}\label{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}}

There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Simply follow along in the .html formatted document that is available on via GitHub Pages, and then

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Locate the original documents at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_Topics}{GitHub repository} . You can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open them to simply take note of the ``behind the scenes'' script
  \item
    copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you
  \item
    fork a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The \href{https://desktop.github.com/}{GitHub Desktop app} makes this easy!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning.
\item
  Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits,
  \item
    start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then
  \item
    sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{if-you-are-new-to-r}{%
\section{If You are New to R}\label{if-you-are-new-to-r}}

R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing.

I've found that, somewhere on the internet, there's almost always a solution to what I'm trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of things. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a ``scRiptuRe'' file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here -- using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint.

\hypertarget{base-r}{%
\subsection{Base R}\label{base-r}}

The base program is free and is available here: \url{https://www.r-project.org/}

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the instllation, but I will point out a few things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
\item
  The ``cran'' (I think ``cranium'') is the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network.} In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location. Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically ``close to you.''
\item
  You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-studio}{%
\subsection{R Studio}\label{r-studio}}

\emph{R Studio} is the desktop application I work in R. It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system: \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Upper right window: Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Environment: it lists the \emph{objects} that are available to you (e.g., dataframes)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Files: Displays the file structure in your computer's environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it.
  \item
    Packages: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to it, you can see if it is ``on.'' You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the Help window.
  \item
    Viewer and Plots are helpful, later, when we can simultaneously look at our output and still work on our script.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Primary window

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    R Studio runs in the background(in the console). Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here.
  \item
    More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen and I work directly, right here.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{R Markdown} is the way that many analysts write \emph{script}, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  \item
    Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  \item
    In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save{]} into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  \item
    \emph{Packages} are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-hygiene}{%
\subsection{R Hygiene}\label{r-hygiene}}

Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to ``skip this.'' However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting to my students.

\hypertarget{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}{%
\subsubsection{Everything is documented in the .rmd file}\label{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}}

Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file. Why? Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions.

\hypertarget{file-organization}{%
\subsubsection{File organization}\label{file-organization}}

File organization is a critical key to this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a project file folder.
\item
  Put the data file in it.
\item
  Open an R Markdown file.
\item
  Save it in the same file folder.
\item
  When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{chunks}{%
\subsubsection{Chunks}\label{chunks}}

The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is ``chunks.''

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i

``Chunks'' start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did}
\CommentTok{\#here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code)}
\DecValTok{2021} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{1966}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 55
\end{verbatim}

Each chunk must open and close. If one or more of your tic marks get deleted, your chunk won't be read as such and your script will not run. The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out script so it won't run.

Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the ``r.'' These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks -- making it easier to find what you did. You can access them in the ``Chunks'' tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles.

You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics. Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here: \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html}

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsubsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on \emph{packages} to do our work for us. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables).

Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{!}\FunctionTok{require}\NormalTok{(psych))\{}\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"psych"}\NormalTok{)\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Loading required package: psych
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## Warning: package 'psych' was built under R version 4.0.5
\end{verbatim}

To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library. This process must be repeated each time you restart R. I don't open the package (through the ``library(package\_name)'') command until it is time to use it. Especially for new users, I think it's important to connect the functions with the specific packages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#install.packages ("psych")}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{ (psych)}

\subsection{tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown}\label{troubleshooting-in-r-markdown}}

Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In an R script, you must have everything in order -- Every. Single. Time.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package.
  \item
    If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script. You need to run any \emph{prerequisite} script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.)
  \item
    Do you feel lost? clear your global environment (broom) and start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are good.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small.
\item
  Type any warnings you get into a search engine. Odds are, you'll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The package isn't loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages)
  \item
    The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isn't saved in the same folder as the data
  \item
    Errors of punctuation or spelling
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Restart R (it's quick -- not like restarting your computer)
\item
  If you receive an error indicating that a function isn't working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{strategies-for-success}{%
\subsection{stRategies for success}\label{strategies-for-success}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \emph{mechanical is also the conceptual}. Especially when it is \emph{simpler}, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  \item
    If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?).
  \item
    Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just ``run it along'' with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, etc.\\
\item
  The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell\citeyearpar{gladwell_outliers_2008} reminds us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
\item
  Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are NECESSARY, but can also be problematic. It could very well be that updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., ``X has been deprecated for version X.XX''). Moreover, this very well could have happened between my distribution of these resources and your attempt to use it. My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term.
\item
  Embrace your downward dog. Also, walk away, then come back.
\end{itemize}

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify the key differences between training models.
\item
  Distinguish one training model from another based on expected outcomes.\\
\item
  Identify the ``place'' of the Local Clinical Science model, relative to other models.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-push-and-pull-of-science-and-practice}{%
\section{The Push and Pull of Science and Practice}\label{the-push-and-pull-of-science-and-practice}}

Meehl's \citeyearpar[p.~4]{meehl_clinical_1954} catharsis regarding the dissociated state of science and practice is below. We'll turn it into \emph{Reader's Theater} by following Stricker's \citeyearpar{stricker_are_1997} recommendation to substitute \emph{scientist} for the statistical metnod and \emph{practitioner} or the clinical method. If you were in my classroom I would ask or volunteers to be the NARRATOR, the advocate for the \emph{scientist} (italics) and advocate forthe \textbf{practitioner} (bold).

The (statistical method) scientist is often called \textbf{operational, communicable, verifiable, public, objective, reliable, behavioral, testable, rigorous, scientific, precise, careful, trustworthy, experimental, quantitative, down-to-earth, hardheaded, empirical, mathematical, and sound.} Those who dislike the method scientist consider them to be \emph{mechanical, atomistic, additive, cut and dried, artificial, unreal, arbitrary, incomplete, dead, pedantic, fractionated, trivial, forced, static, superficial, rigid, sterile, academic, oversimplified, pseudoscientific, and blind.} The (clinical method) practitioner, on the other hand, is labeled by their proponents as \emph{dynamic, global, meaningful, holistic, subtle, sympathetic, configural, patterned, organized, rich, deep, genuine, sensitive, sophisticated, real, living, concrete, natural, true to life, and understanding}. The critics of the (clinical method) practitioner are likely to view them as \textbf{mystical, transcendent, metaphysical, super-mundane, vague, hazy, subjective, unscientific, unreliable, crude, private, unverifiable, qualitative, primitive, prescientific, sloppy, uncontrolled, careless, verbalistic, intuitive, and muddleheaded}.

\hypertarget{training-models-accreditation}{%
\section{Training Models \& Accreditation}\label{training-models-accreditation}}

APA accredited programs must (but most all grad psych programs do):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  define and articulate their own training philosophies,
\item
  demonstrate that the outcomes of the training are consistent with the model
\item
  do so because of the need for (and value of) public accountability
\end{itemize}

All currently accredited doctoral programs in clinical have a ``pure'' model affiliation or some variation thereof.

Most common models:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  clinical scientist,
\item
  scientist-practitioner,
\item
  with updated proposal for scientist-practitioner-advocate (Mallinckrodt et al., 2014)
\item
  practitioner-scholar models
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scientistpractitioner-sp-model}{%
\subsection{Scientist\textasciitilde Practitioner (SP) Model}\label{scientistpractitioner-sp-model}}

The scientist\textasciitilde practitioner model is also known as the Boulder Model. It originated in 1949 with formal articulation in 1950 \citep{conference_on_graduate_education_in_clinical_psychology_training_1950}. It is characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Primary goal: equal provision of extensive training in psychological research and the applications of that research to eventual practice---that is, to the creation of the SP psychologist (Cherry et al., 2000).
\item
  Began in clinical psychology; prominent training model in school, counseling, and I/O psych programs
\item
  Model re-articulated at the National Conference on SP Education and Training for the Professional Practice of Psychology, Gainesville, FL, 1990 (Belar \& Perry, 1992).
\item
  Major theme: SP ≠ summation; SP ≠ continuum; SP = integration. New symbols: not S-P, but SXP or S\textasciitilde P
\item
  Major theme: ``The graduate of this training model is capable of functioning as an investigator and as a practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent with the highest standards in psychology.''
\item
  Training components of the SP model (Belar \& Perry, 1992):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Didactic scientific
  \item
    Didactic practice core
  \item
    Experiential scientific
  \item
    Professional practice experiential
  \item
    Integration of Education \& Training
  \item
    System components (faculty, setting, evaluation procedures)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In spite of this idealism, many argue that the S\textasciitilde P model is really an S model (e.g., Stricker \& Trierweiler, 2006). Just what evidence is there or this?
\end{itemize}

A mixed methods study \citep{ridley_scientistpractitioner_2015} surveyed training directors in counseling psychology programs. Training directors indicated the degree to which each of nine program components fell in the continuum of science-to-practice. Table 6 in the manuscript shows the results (and is worth a look). Overall the programs leaned heavily toward ``science'' with four of the criteria being rated as ``heavily science.'' These included

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statistics and resaerch methodology
\item
  Psychology core course
\item
  Resaerch experiences
\item
  Dissertation experiences
\end{itemize}

Only \emph{practica courses} were rated as heavily practice. The remaining criteria fell between the two. These included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Criteria for student evaluations.
\item
  Counseling psychology core courses
\item
  Our program overall
\item
  Diagnostic/assessment courses.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scholar-practitioner-sch-p-model}{%
\subsection{Scholar-Practitioner (SCH-P) Model}\label{scholar-practitioner-sch-p-model}}

The scholar-practitioner model is also known as the Vail model. It originated in 1973 when the National Institute for Mental Health and the American Psychological Association met in Vail, Colorado. It is characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Primary goal: the preparation for ``delivery of human services in a manner that is effective and responsive to individual needs, societal needs, and diversity'' \citep[p.~159]{mcholland_national_1992}.
\item
  Operationalized as the capacity to conduct disciplined inquiry (rather than producing controlled lab or field research)
\item
  Ivey and Leppaluoto \citeyearpar{ivey_changes_1975} summarized the major emphases of this model; the original summary is found in Korman \citeyearpar{korman_national_1974}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Awareness of values; not promotion of ``right values''
  \item
    Attention to human diversity and culture
  \item
    Scientist practitioner: professional training as a legitimate alternative.
  \item
    Individual v program training (e.g., continuing education {[}CE{]})
  \item
    Specifically, the conferands concluded that when primary training emphasis is on the production of new knowledge, the Ph.D.~is appropriate; when primary emphasis is on professional services, evaluation, and improving services, the Psy.D. is appropriate.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{clinical-scientist-model}{%
\subsection{Clinical Scientist Model}\label{clinical-scientist-model}}

The clinical science model was created by the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science in 1974. It is characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Primary goal: to provide training in the production of scientific research on clinical problems and its application to those problems (Academy of Psychological Clinical Science, 1997).
\item
  ``Clinical science'' is defined as a psychological science directed at the promotion of adaptive functioning; at the assessment, understanding, amelioration, and prevention of human problems in behavior, affect, cognition or health; and at the application of knowledge in ways consistent with scientific evidence. The Academy's emphasis on the term ``science'' underscores its commitment to empirical approaches to evaluating the validity and utility of testable hypotheses and to advancing knowledge by this method.
\end{itemize}

A flavor of this model can be found in a McFall's \citeyearpar{mcfall_manifesto_1991} \href{http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/0102/apcs_manifesto.html}{Manifesto for a Science of Clinical Psychology}\url{http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/McFall_Manifesto_1991.pdf}). McFcall declared that ``Scientific clinical psychology is the only legitimate and acceptable form of clinical psychology'' should be a ``Cardinal Principle.'' To that end:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First Corollary: Psychological services should not be administered to the public (except under strict experimental control) until they have satisfied these four - - The exact nature of the service must be described clearly.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The claimed benefits of the service must be stated explicitly.
  \item
    These claimed benefits must be validated scientifically
  \item
    Possible negative side effects that might outweigh any benefits must be ruled out empirically.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Second Corollary: The primary and overriding objective of doctoral training programs in clinical psychology must be to produce the most competent clinical scientists possible.
\item
  Change is constant;\href{https://www.pcsas.org/}{PCSAS} offers an accreditation program that competes with APA's.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{local-clinical-scientist-model-lcs}{%
\subsection{Local Clinical Scientist Model (LCS)}\label{local-clinical-scientist-model-lcs}}

The local clinical scientist model emerged in a series of writing \citep{stricker_are_1997, stricker_local_1995, stricker_local_2006, trierweiler_research_2010, trierweiler_scientific_1998}. It is characterized by the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Elaborates, extends, optimizes, makes real the Boulder scientist-practitioner model
\item
  A scientific approach and inquiring attitude of curiosity, skepticism, hypothesis testing and reframing within the local setting
\item
  Breaking it down:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{clinical scientist} reflects our commitment to psychology as both a scientific discipline and a healthcare profession.
  \item
    \emph{local} refers to the particular application of general science, within local cultures, including the idiographic aspects of persons, families, and communities, in specific space-time and relational contexts
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{and-what-does-it-mean}{%
\subsection{And What Does It Mean?}\label{and-what-does-it-mean}}

Norcross et al.\citeyearpar{norcross_doctoral_2020} evaluated 20-year trends of counseling psychology programs in terms of program, student, and faculty comparisons -- and also compared it to clinical psychology. The tables in the Norcross et al.~manuscript are worth reviewing. Generally results demonstrated:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there are more applicants to research-oriented programs
\item
  a fewer percentage of students are to research-oriented programs
\item
  there is more funding in research oriented programs
\item
  there are non-significant differences for gender
\item
  there is a lower percent of students of color in practice-oriented programs
\item
  there is a shorter time required to complete practice oriented programs
\item
  GREs are higher in research oriented programs
\end{itemize}

Regarding differences between counseling psychology and clinical psychology programs, Norcross et al.\citeyearpar{norcross_doctoral_2020} reported that there were non-significant differences in the number of incoming students each year, but that there was greater numbers of applications received and, thereore, a smaller proportion of students accepted in clinical psychology programs. There was not a statistically significant diference in the percentage of students receiving full tuition waivers and assistantships. Regarding student characteristics, clinical psychology programs had somewhat higher GRE scores and students were more likely to enter having completed a bachelor's degree. Regarding counseling psychology programs, more students had completed a master's level degree. There were more female students in clinical psychology programs; there were more ethnic minority students and international students in counseling psychology programs.

Regarding theoretical orientation, counseling psychology programs were more likely to be psychodynamic/psychoanalytic, family systems/systems, and existential/humanistic. Clinical psychology programs were more likely to be applied behavioral analysis/radical behavioral and cognitive/cognitive-behavioral.Clinical psychology programs reported a stronger research-practice emphasis.

Cherry et al. \citeyearpar{cherry_examination_2000} examined outcomes related to training model. Perhaps not surprisingly, research and publication productivity was highest among programs with a clinical scientist training model, followed by the scientist-practitioner training model, followed by the scholar-practitioner model. Service delivery was the the opposite order. Regarding post-doctoral employment settings, graduates from clinical psychology programs often held employment in academic settings. Graduates of scholar-practitioner programs most often held employment in community mental health centers and other/multiple settings. Graduates from scientist-practitioner programs had more of a diverse profile in post-doctoral employment.

\hypertarget{what-lies-ahead}{%
\subsection{What Lies Ahead?}\label{what-lies-ahead}}

Mallinckrodt et al. \citeyearpar{mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014} has proposed a scientist-practitioner-advocate training model for doctoral training in professional psychology, ``designed to more effectively meet the needs of clients whose presenting problems are rooted in a sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities.'' This model has been represented with three intersecting circles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  where science and practice overlap, science informs practice and practice generates research ideas,
\item
  where practice and advocacy overlap, there is advocacy for clients, empowering them to advocate for themselves,
\item
  where advocacy and science overlap, there is action resaerch and research as advocacy,
\item
  at the center where all three overlap is a practicum in social justice advocacy.
\end{itemize}

The scientist-practitioner-advocate model prioritizes four outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Developing an understanding how the context of social problems impacts the lives of individuals;
\item
  Demonstrating skills in the methods of social action research and be able to use empirical skills as tools for advocacy and to promote social change;
\item
  Developing effective interventions targeted at the level of institutions or systems influencing public policy decisions and evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions; and
\item
  Learning to work with individual clients to help them make informed choices about the cost and benefits of engaging in advocacy for themselves.
\end{itemize}

The \href{https://psychology.utk.edu/grad/spa_model.php}{University of Tennessee Counseling Psychology Program} and provides a practical example of how it has been operationalized in their program.

Accredited programs are required to provide details about their training models in their program materials. These are often foundin doctoral handbooks, research and dissertation guidelines, and clinical trainng guidelines.

\hypertarget{suggestions-for-practice}{%

If you are in a graduate training program in psychology (or considering the possibility of further trainng and education):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Does your program have a specified and articulated model?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If yes, what is it? How does it compare to the descriptions in this lesson?
  \item
    If no, based on what you know about the program how would you describe it?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Interview at least two faculty. How do they identify and describe the trainng model of the program?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Do the programmatic characteristics and outcomes align with those reported in Norcross et al. \citeyearpar{norcross_doctoral_2020} and Cherry et al \citeyearpar{cherry_examination_2000}?

Think for a minute what you know about riding a bicycle, where you know it from, and then what you would think about ``freeing up'' the stop-sign rule to let cyclists pass through (without a full stop) if it were safe to do so.

\hypertarget{ways-of-knowing}{%
\subsection{Ways of Knowing}\label{ways-of-knowing}}

\textbf{Epistemology}: the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and validity.

One epistemological interest is in determining how we know what we know.

Jhangiani \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} and colleages listed five sources of knowledge. There are benefits and liabilities to each of these:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Intuiton}: relying on emotions and instincts; believing what feels true.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because instincts are driven by cognitive and motivational biases, they can be wrong.
  \item
    When weighing alternatives and thinking of all the different possibilities can be paralyzing, some intuitive decisions are superior to those based on analyses.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Authority}: accepting new ideas because an authority figure states it is true (parents, media, doctors, religious officials, the government, your professor 😊).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If authorities are wrong or corrupt, following without questioning is problematic.
  \item
    If authorities are correct, following is time-saving and more efficient.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Rationalism}: using logic and reasoning to acquire new knowledge. Premises are stated and logical rules are followed to arrive at sound conclusion.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the premises are wrong or there is an error in logic, then the conclusion is invalid.
  \item
    If the premises are correct and logical rules are followed appropriately -- it works!

  \emph{Empiricism}: acquiring knowledge through observation and experience.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We are limited in what we can experience (e.g., the world as flat) and observe and our senses deceive us; our prior experiences can alter perception.

\textbf{Back to the bicycling vignette}

There's more to this story.

As of October 1st, 2020, cyclists in Washington State have been able to treat stop signs (not stoplights, railway crossings, or stop signal displayed by school busses) as yield signs (Dahl, 2020, 2020). The two articles from the Bellingham Herald walk us through some of the ways of knowing that led the Washington legislature to its widely passing margins (77 to 20 House; 44 to 1 Senate; \citep{fucoloro_bipartisan_2020}).

Let's think through the ways of knowing to understand the components that brought about this new law.

\emph{Intuition}: Depending on your own emotions and instincts, you may have widely-varying impressions. Mine? YES! That will make my life easier -- and other drivers won't be angry when I lose momentum in the slowing and stopping. On the other hand, drivers may get really mad if they think I'm breaking the law.

\emph{Experience}: It's my experience that I'm more efficient (faster, smoother) if I can ``slow-through'' a stop-sign; particularly on right turns. This in turn, would make it faster for drivers.

\emph{Authority}: Idaho passed a similar in 1982 (dubbed the ``Idaho stop''), Delaware in 2017 (the ``Delaware Yield), Oregon in 2019.

\emph{Empiricism}: Many cycling accidents happen in intersections. Traveling quickly through an intersection minimizes risk. Thus, momentum matters. Dahl \citeyearpar{dahl_heres_2020}gathered his own data. After a complete stop, it took 5.4 seconds to clear the intersection; entering at 5mph took only 3.8 seconds. This is 30\% of time spent in one of the most probable places for cyclist/driver collisions.

\emph{The Scientific Method}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A year after the Idaho law went into effect, bicycle injuries dropped 14\%.
\item
  A UC Berkeley transportation researcher (Jason Meggs) found that cyling was 30\% to 60\% safer in Boise (home of the Idaho Stop law) than in Sacramento and 150 to 252 times safer than in Bakersfield California.
\end{itemize}

Things to ponder: How would you have voted? Are there arguments for fairness/equity/equality in this argument (e.g., bicycles should have to follow same rules as cars)?

\hypertarget{a-faith-based-model}{%
\subsection{A Faith-Based Model}\label{a-faith-based-model}}

For a faith-based, Methodist, take, John Wesley built on the Anglican faith tradition by adding a fourth emphases (experience), to create what is now termed the Wesleyan Quadrilateral \citep{noauthor_glossary_nodate}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Scripture}: defined as the primary source and standard for Christian doctrine
\item
  \emph{Tradition}: experience and the witness of development of growth of the faith through the past centuries and in many nations and cultures
\item
  \emph{Experience}: the individual's understanding and appropriating of the faith in the light of his or her own life.
\item
  \emph{Reason}: discernment and cogent thought.
\end{itemize}

These traditions are clearly White, Western, and male. There are, of course, other ways do ask the question How do we know? As well as different answers to the question.

\hypertarget{race-based-epistemologies}{%
\subsection{Race-Based Epistemologies}\label{race-based-epistemologies}}

Rajack-Talley et al. \citeyearpar{rajack-talley_epistemological_2017} address this in a paper describing how they were intentional to include researchers with different epistemologies (``race-based epistemologies'') in an NIH-funded study of three Black communities in Kentucky.

The NIH-study \citep{della_modeling_2016} was a multi-staged, mixed methods, NIH-funded study examining individual, community, and cultural-level determinants of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in Black residents in two low-income cities in Kentucky (Louisville, Hopkinsville).

Proponents of race-based epistemologies argue:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the life experiences of African descent are integral to the analysis of research, then there should be some degree of an Afro-centric, Black, or race-based epistemological framework
\item
  This includes the adoption of the \emph{emic} approach that recognizes there are distinct historical and cultural experiences of African people; the emic approach includes the community's understandings and interpretations of their conditions and experiences
\item
  ``Outsiders'' who are researching the other are wise to maintain a critical relationship to the research topic (and population) through self-reflexivity (self-reflection by the researchers and acknowledgement that there are differences between the researcher and those being studied).
\end{itemize}

One distinction is the difference in insider and outsider perspectives:
* \textbf{etic}:
- standing far enough away, on the outside,
- with the purpose of observing similarities/differences from other cultures;
- the primary interest is in testing hypotheses, identifying common/universal aspects of human behavior that transcend cultural differences.
- assumes all cultures can be observed as generalizable phenomena with comparable features and universalistic measures
* \textbf{emic}:
- standing on the inside
- with the purpose of identifying culture-specific elements or human behavior that are not comparable across cultures
- measures are relative
- argues that meaningful distinctions can only be made by people within the cultures
- assumes that the best way to understand a culture is from the perspectives and values of those being observed

\textbf{Black feminist epistemology} (as cited in \citep{hill_collins_black_2000}) as an example of a race-based epistemology

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Concrete experiences are treated as a criterion of meaning
\item
  Dialogues are used in assessing knowledge claims
\item
  An ethic of caring is developed
\item
  An ethic of personal accountability is accepted
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{defining-research-and-some-of-its-key-concepts}{%
\section{Defining Research (And {[}Some Of{]}) Its Key Concepts}\label{defining-research-and-some-of-its-key-concepts}}

\emph{Science} is generally characterized by three components \citep{jhangiani_research_2019}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Systematic empiricism}: planning, making, recording, analyzing observations of the natural world
\item
  \textbf{Empirical questions}: concerning the way the world \emph{is} not the way the world \emph{ought to be}.
\item
  \textbf{Public knowledge}: the data contributes to public knowledge; publication in academia (sharing knowledge and self-correcting); open science movement.
\end{itemize}

The purpose of research is to draw valid inferences about the relationships between variables \citep{kazdin_research_2017}

\textbf{Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the diverse principles, procedures, and practices that govern research.
\item
  those practices that help to arrange the circumstances so as to minimize ambiguity in reaching the inferences.
\item
  more than a compilation of specific practices, procedures, and strategies.
\item
  a way of thinking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Research Design}. The plan or arrangement used to examine the question of interest (\emph{research design is subordinate to the concept of methodology}).

\textbf{Parsimony}. This concept is sometimes referred to the principle of economy, the principle of unnecessary plurality, the principle of simplicity, and Occam's razor).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Parsimony directs us to select the simplest version or account of the data among the alternatives that are available.
\item
  Parsimony means that plurality should not be posited without necessity (Occam's razor)
\item
  Parsimony asks, ``Must we introduce new concepts to explain the data? What about new variables?''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Plausible Rival Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An interpretation of the results of an investigation on the basis of some other influence than the one the investigator has studied or wishes to discuss.
\item
  Are there other interpretations that are plausible to explain the findings?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Statistical inference}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  related to experimentation because of the extensive reliance on statistical tests in research to draw conclusions from the data.
\item
  statistical controls help to reduce the plausibility of rival interpretations of the results.
\item
  agreed-upon decision rules
\end{itemize}

At the completion of a study the explanation one wishes to provide ought to be the most plausible interpretation. This is achieved not by arguing persuasively, but rather by designing the study in such a way that other explanations do not seem very plausible or parsimonious \citep{kazdin_research_2017}.

\hypertarget{philosophy-of-science-as-it-relates-to-research-methodology}{%
\section{Philosophy of Science as it Relates to Research Methodology}\label{philosophy-of-science-as-it-relates-to-research-methodology}}

\textbf{Philosophy of Science}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Considers the logical and epistemological underpinnings of the scientific method in general.
\item
  Historically, experimentation has been closely tied to philosophical thought. The very notion of hypothesis derives from philosophy.
\item
  (among other things) reveals fundamental limitations in the logical underpinnings of observational and experimental methods.
\end{itemize}

Two great articles that were written about qualitative methods, provide an accessible and concise review of philosophy of science as it connects to research in clinical \citep{ponterotto_qualitative_2005} and industrial-organizational \citep{cortina_doing_2013} psychology. Much of this chapter is based on these articles.

\textbf{Paradigm}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A set of interrelated assumptions about the social world which provides a philosophical and conceptual framework for the organized study of that world.
\item
  The paradigm sets the context for an investigator's study.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Positivism} is the research paradigm that will guide most of our work in this class.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A form of philosophical realism adhering closely to the hypothetico-deductive model.
\item
  Primary goal: explanation that leads to prediction and control of phenomena.
\item
  The received view (the one everyone is working under)
\item
  There is one, true, knowable reality.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Postpositivism}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Acknowledge an objective reality that is only imperfectly apprehendable; thus we can never fully capture a ``true'' reality (although it exists).
\item
  While positivists stress ``theory verification,'' postpositivists engage in ``theory falsification.''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Positivism \& Postpositivism shared variance}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Explanation that leads to prediction and control.
\item
  Emphasis of cause-effect linkages.
\item
  An objective, detached, researcher role.
\item
  Operation from nomothetic (application to people generally) and etic (universal laws and behaviors that transcend nations and cultures and apply to all humans) perspectives.
\item
  Primary foundation/anchor for quantitative research.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Constructivism -- Interpretivism}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Relativist position assumes multiple, apprehendable, and equally valid realities.
\item
  Reality is constructed.
\item
  Hermeneutical approach -- researcher/participant dialogue
\item
  Meaning is hidden and must be brought to the surface through deep reflection.
\item
  Goals are idiographic (applying to the individual) and emic (constructs or behaviors that are unique to an individual, sociocultural context, that are not generalizable).
\item
  Emphasis on understanding the Erlebnis (lived experience)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical-Ideological}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Serves to disrupt and challenge the status quo
\item
  Paradigm is one of emancipation and transformation
\item
  The researchers' proactive values are central to the task, purpose, and methods of research
\item
  Critical theory is traced to the 1920s at the Institute of Social Research at the University of Frankfurt. In Nazi-controlled Germany, the scholars fled to California to be ``shocked by American culture\ldots by the contradictions between progressive American rhetoric of egalitarianism and the reality of racial and class discrimination.''
\item
  There is no single critical theory; a criticalist use his/her work as a form of cultural or social criticism.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{paradigmatic-impact-on-onology-epistemology-axiology-rhetorical-structure-and-methodology}{%
\subsection{Paradigmatic Impact on Onology, Epistemology, Axiology, Rhetorical Structure, and Methodology}\label{paradigmatic-impact-on-onology-epistemology-axiology-rhetorical-structure-and-methodology}}

\textbf{Ontology}: the nature and reality of being. Answers the questions, ``What is the form and nature of reality? What can be known about reality?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Positivists}: There is one true reality that is apprehendable, identifiable, measurable (i.e., naïve realism).
\item
  \emph{Post positivists}: There is one true reality, but it can only be apprehended and measured imperfectly (i.e., critical realism).
\item
  \emph{Constructivists---interpretivists}: There are multiple, constructed realities (i.e., relativism). Reality is subjective and influenced by the context of the situation, namely the individual's experience and perceptions, the social environment, and the interaction between the individual and the researcher.
\item
  \emph{Criticalists}: Reality is constructed within a social-historical context. The criticalist focuses on power-relations. They will assume that marginalized clients are likely have different levels of access and will present research data to pressure those in power to change.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Epistemology}: the relationship between the ``knower'' (research participant) and the ``would be knower'' (researcher).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Positivists}: emphasize dualism (i.e., researcher and the research participant and topic are assumed to be independent of one another) and objectivism (i.e., by following rigorous, standard procedures, the participant and topic can be studied by the researcher without bias).
\item
  \emph{Post positivists}: advocate a modified dualism/objectivism. The researcher may have some influence on that being researched, but the objectivity and researcher-subject independence remain important guidelines for the research process.
\item
  \emph{Constructivists-interpretivists}: advocate a transactional and subjectivist stance that maintains that reality is socially constructed, and therefore, the dynamic interaction between researcher and participant is central to capturing and describing the lived experience of the participant.
\item
  \emph{Criticalists}: concern with dialogic (gaining research insight through interaction) and dialectic (transforming research participants toward empowerment and emancipation). Collaboration with the research participants includes the goal of helping them gain insights that contribute toward their own liberation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Axiology}: the role of researcher values in the scientific process.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Positivists/post positivists}: There is no place for values in the research process. The psychology researcher should remain emotionally detached from the investigative inquiry. Values, hopes, expectations, feelings have no place in scientific inquiry. Standardized, systematic investigative methods allowed elimination and/or strict control over any influence the researcher may have on the process.
\item
  \emph{Constructivists-interpretivists}: Maintain that the researcher's values and lived experience cannot be divorced from the research process. The researcher should acknowledge, describe, and ``bracket'' his/her values, but not eliminate them.
\item
  \emph{Criticalists}: Explicitly hope and expect that their value biases influence the research process and outcome. A preset goal of the research is to empower participants to transform the status quo and emancipate themselves from ongoing oppression.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rhetorical Structure}: the language used to present the procedures and results of research to one's intended audience. Rhetoric flows closely from one's epistemological and axiological stance.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Positivist/Post positivists}: Rhetoric is precise and ``scientific,'' presented in an objective manner.
\item
  \emph{Constructivist-interpretivists/Criticalists}: Final research report is in first person and often personalized. The researcher's own experience, expectations, biases, and values are detailed comprehensively.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Methodology}: the process and procedures of the research.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Positivists/Post positivists}: attempt to simulate, as closely as possible, strict scientific methods and procedures where variables are carefully controlled or manipulated and where the researcher's emotional or expectant stance on the problem under the study is irrelevant. Heavy reliance on true experiments and analog methods; quasi-experimental methods when no alternative is available.
\item
  \emph{Constructivist-interpretivists/Criticalists}: embrace naturalistic designs in which the researcher is ensconced in the community and day-to-day life of their research participants. Research methods include in-depth face-to-face interviewing and participant observation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{One of Ponterotto's (2005) finest moments!}
It is important that counseling researchers understand and clearly explicate their operating paradigm in the reporting of studies\ldots it is essential that researchers, as well as journal editorial board members and grant reviewers ``locate'' research studies within a specific research paradigm. (p.~132).

\hypertarget{things-im-thinking-about}{%
\subsection{Things I'm Thinking About}\label{things-im-thinking-about}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why is it important to include race-based epistemologies?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mistrust comes from factual and perceived instances of exploitation and discrimination in a history of medical abuse, racism, failure to provide information/fully-informed-consent, racial stigmas, poor recruitment \citep{rajack-talley_epistemological_2017}
  \item
    ``Although these recommendations can be seen as `simply good field research,' they are particularly important in researching the African American community because of the group's history and because more recent data collection has been used to negatively depict this racial group'' (\citep{rajack-talley_epistemological_2017} p.~413).
  \item
    The Rajack-Talley et al. \citeyearpar{rajack-talley_epistemological_2017} manuscript demonstrates how a multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary team worked together to develop approaches that contributed to success in a complex NIH-funded research project from participation, engagement, and interpretation of results. Techniques included self-reflexivity, transect walks, conducting interviews in participants' homes or familiar places with Black team members, collecting data in community locations including other trusted members of the community (e.g., family, friend, pastor, barber).
  \item
    Finally, let me recommend a very cool (38-minute) \href{https://www.npr.org/2020/07/27/895858974/creativity-and-diversity-how-exposure-to-different-people-affects-our-thinking}{episode of Hidden Brain} where Shankar Vedantam talks with researchers about the benefits of diversity on outcomes -- including scientific research:

Learning objectives from this lecture include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Starting with a simple post-test only design, identify limitations and remedies that lead, incrementally, to more robust conclusions with regard to ruling out confounds and plausible rival hypotheses.
\item
  Define internal, external, construct, and statistical conclusion validity and well as each of their subtypes.
\item
  In the context of research design vignettes, specify the threats to validity and identify potential remedies.\\
\item
  Discuss the tension between internal and external validity (and its connection to efficacy and effectiveness research). Support the discussion with citations.

\section{In the Beginning There Was\ldots{}}\label{in-the-beginning-there-was}}

\emph{``The backbone of psychology, rightly so, rests on randomized-studies, analyzed by analysis of variance''} \citep{kenny_enhancing_2019}

Because I give these lectures in our analysis of variance class, this chapter is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  located in positivist and post-positivist philosophies of science
\item
  presumes there is the aspirational goal of inferring causality
\end{itemize}

It is impossible to discuss causality or ANOVA without discussion of validity. In \citeyearpar{campbell_factors_1957}, Campbell introduced the concepts of internal and external validity. Campbell and Stanley \citeyearpar{campbell_experimental_1963-1} expanded these ideas. More than a decade later, Cook and Campbell \citeyearpar{cook_quasi-experimentation_1979} introduced construct and conclusion (aka ``statistical conclusion'' or ``statistical conclusive'') validity. In 2002, those discussions were extended in Shadish, Cook, and Campbell's \citeyearpar{shadish_experimental_2002} text, Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference.

This path of articles often focuses on methods associated with the research design. In his \citeyearpar{kenny_enhancing_2019} article on enhancing validity in psychological research, Kenny argued for sophisticated statistical approaches (e.g., structural equation modeling, dyadic analysis, mediation) that also support causal inference. However, the focus of our class is the research design and the use of the ANOVA family of statistics.

As we talk through today's topics, we'll use the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} experimental manipulation of the exceptionalizing stereotype with a sample of Asian and Asiam American individuals. In this experiment, Asian American participants (all \textless{} 26 y.o., having arrived in the U.S. by age 12) were assigned to three different conditions where a White confederate delivered one of three messages:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Nice talking to you. You speak English well'' -- low racial loading
\item
  ``Nice talking to you. You speak English well for an Asian'' -- high racial loading
\item
  ``Nice talking to you'' -- control
\end{itemize}

There were multiple outcome evaluations in the study:

\textbf{Pre \& post-interaction (before and after hearing the microaggression)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluation: ``How positive is your impression of this person?''
\item
  Perceived acceptance: ``How much do you think this person will like you?''
\item
  Enjoyable: ``How enjoyable do you believe the interaction will be?''
\item
  Similar: ``How similar do you think your interaction partner will be?''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Post-interaction only (after hearing the microaggression)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Accurate: how accurate the participant believed the White confederate's impression was
\item
  Additional talk time: how much longer they would continue the interaction
\end{itemize}

Tran and Lee's \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} study \textbf{is an experiment}. However, we'll \emph{imagine} different research designs and use them to illustrate threats to the validity of the conclusions.

A treatment is implemented (or an IV is manipulated) and a dependent variable (DV) is measured once after the treatment is implemented.

\textbf{Hypothetical scenario}

\midrule
\endhead
Low racial loading & Not applicable & None & Yes: ``Nice talking to you. You speak English well.'' & Accuracy, Additional talk time \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

This the weakest type of quasi-experimental design.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Without a control group, we cannot tell if the degree of additional talk time would be different if the racial loading had been different.
\item
  Without a pre-test (and measures conducive to the pretest) we cannot know if the Asian American participants' reactions change as a function of the microaggression
\end{itemize}

How does this change if we add a pretest?

\hypertarget{one-group-pretest-posttest-design}{%
\subsection{One-group pretest-posttest design:}\label{one-group-pretest-posttest-design}}

The DV is measured once before the treatment/intervention/manipulation is implemented and once after the treatment/intervention/manipulation.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 8\tabcolsep) * \real{0.12}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 8\tabcolsep) * \real{0.20}}

\midrule
\endhead
Low racial loading & Not applicable & Evaluation, Perceived Acceptance, Enjoyable, Similar & Yes: ``Nice talking to you. You speak English well.'' & Evaluation, Perceived Acceptance, Enjoyable, Similar \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Now we can at least estimate if there has been change in the score from pre- to post-test. We cannot conclude this with any certainty -- because we do not know if this would have changed as a function of the treatment/intervention/manipulation.

Our inability to draw causal inferences has to do with threats to internal validity.

\item
  The veracity of the claim of a cause-effect relationship.

  \item

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Primary concern: provide evidence of causal linkages.
\item
  Advanced cognitive organizer (or a spoiler alert): a genuine RCT with zero attrition solves most problems associated with internal validity.

\subsection{Threats to Internal Validity as a Function of One-Sample Designs}\label{threats-to-internal-validity-as-a-function-of-one-sample-designs}}

\textbf{History}: any event occurring in or outside of the experiment (other than the IV) that may account for the results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}: A pre-test defines a period of time and a control group controls for any historical interference (e.g., national levels of racism connected to COVID-19)
\item
  In other research: 911 occurred in the midst of my longitudinal study on expats (no control group)
\item
  Commonly occurs in: one-group designs (post-only, or pre-post)
\item
  Remedy: no-treatment control group with the same schedule
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Maturation}: changing over time; only a problem if the design cannot distinguish the effects of maturational changes from the intervention.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}: Similarly, a pre-test defines a period of time and a control group controls for any developmental change/growth
\item
  In other research: expats in my longitudinal study increase their Turkish language skills (just b/c they live in Turkey)
\item
  Commonly occurs in: one-group designs (post-only, or pre-post)
\item
  Remedy: no-treatment control group with the same schedule
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Testing}: influence of testing that may impact subsequent performance (i.e., pre-test influences post-test).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}: Even though there was ``filler,'' it is possible that pre-test items cued the participants to the topic of micro-aggressions; comparison groups would help detect this
\item
  In other research: expats in my longitudinal study show increase in sociocultural adaptation -- because over the 5 waves, they are cued to its importance
\item
  Commonly occurs in: designs with a pre-test
\item
  Remedy: no-treatment control group with the same schedule would allow its measurement; a Solomon 4-square (where a treatment and non-treatment group does not get a pre-test would provide even greater control).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Instrumentation}: changes in the measuring instrument or measurement procedures over time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}: NA.
\item
  In other research: Research team members are categorizing counselor ``utterances'' (e.g., open-ended questions, closed-ended questions, reframes, restatements, challenges) and the meanings/definitions of these shift over time.
\item
  Commonly occurs in: Designs with human raters
\item
  Remedy: standardized measures, automated scoring devices, manipulation checks, strict standardized procedures, assessing inter-rater reliability
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Statistical Regression toward the mean}: the tendency for extreme scores on any measure to revert (or regress) toward the mean of a distribution at re-administration.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}: If there had been an immediate national news story related to racism toward Asian Americans related to COVID-19 and the study occurred in that day (but then the post-test would have needed to be spaced further out).
\item
  In other research: Parental stress is extremely high when the parent enrolls in a parenting class and it is less high at the next measurement
\item
  Commonly occurs in: Designs where research participants are enrolled when they present for services
\item
  Remedy: random assignment to treatment; no-treatment control groups
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spontaneous remission}: the tendency for medical and psychological problems to improve over time without any form of treatment

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}: difficult to imagine
\item
  In other research: the presence of depression symptoms that are not present six months later
\item
  Commonly occurs in: Designs where research participants are enrolled when they are patients who present for services
\item
  Remedy: random assignment to treatment \& no-treatment control groups
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{experimental-designs}{%
\section{Experimental Designs}\label{experimental-designs}}

Research can achieve the state of experimental when

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The analysis seeks to determine whether changes in the independent variable (IV, a factor or predictor variable with two or more conditions/levels) lead to change in the dependent variable (DV, outcome variable);
\item
  To rule out potential confounds and plausible rival hypotheses, there is maximum control over extraneous variables/noise; this control might be achieved through

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Inclusion/exclusion criteria,
  \item
    Manualized protocols,
  \item
    Standardization of context/setting.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The IV/factor is systematically manipulated; comparing two groups of people who differ on the IV is not an experiment (see Jhangiani et al.'s \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} chapter on non-equivalent group designs);
\item
  Random assignment to the conditions. This is the gold standard; without random assignment there is no experiment.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A random clinical trial involves random assignment to treatment and control conditions,
  \item
    Causality is often better established when the control condition offers a placebo (a believed-to-be inert condition that looks like the treatment condition). Placebos often work! Just for fun (optional) see WNYC's Radiolab story on \href{https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/91539-placebo}{Placebo} and Hidden Brain's episode, All the World's a Stage -- \href{https://www.npr.org/2020/05/11/853753307/all-the-worlds-a-stage-including-the-doctor-s-office}{Including the Doctor's Office}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For ethical and practical reasons (i.e., the researchers believe the treatment is effective and wish it to be given to many), there can be a \textbf{wait-list control condition}.
\end{itemize}

Within this broad category of a variety of designs consider the following:

\hypertarget{between-subject-experiments}{%
\subsection{Between-Subject Experiments}\label{between-subject-experiments}}

Each person is randomly assigned and tested in only one condition. This would have been the case for Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014}, had there not been a pre-test observation.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 6\tabcolsep) * \real{0.27}}

  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 6\tabcolsep) * \real{0.34}}@{}}
\toprule
Group & Assignment & Manipulation & Post-test observation \\
\midrule
\endhead
Low racial loading & Random & Yes: ``Nice talking to you. You speak English well.'' & Evaluation, Perceived acceptance, Enjoyable, Similar, Accuracy, Additional talk time \\
High racial loading & Random & Yes: ``Nice talking to you. You speak English well for an Asian.'' & Evaluation, perceived acceptance, Enjoyable, Similar, Accuracy, Additional talk time \\
Control & Random & Yes: ``Nice talking to you.'' & Evaluation, perceived acceptance, Enjoyable, Similar, Accuracy, Additional talk time \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Random assignment protocols can be achieved in a variety of programs including R and \href{https://www.randomizer.org/}{randomizer.org}.

Random assignment is often determined one participant at a time (i.e., \textbf{simple random assignment} where each person has an equal chance of being randomly assigned to any of the groups). When there is strict need for \textbf{balanced designs} (equal cell/group sizes), a \textbf{block randomization} protocol can be specified (i.e., all conditions occur once in the sequence before any of them is repeated; then they all occur again before any is repeated). Within each of these ``blocks'' the conditions occur in a random order.

For example, if Tran and Lee had used a block randomization, the first nine assignments might have looked like this:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
Participant & Condition \\
\midrule
\endhead
1 & Low \\
2 & High \\
3 & Control \\
4 & High \\
5 & Low \\
6 & Control \\
7 & Control \\
8 & Low \\
9 & High \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Matched groups} is an variant of simple random assignment. Here, participants are ranked on some variable the researcher wishes to control. If Tran and Lee believed that internalized racism would impact the outcomes, the participants could take a pre-test of internalized racism. Participants could be placed in rank order of score. The highest three would be randomly assigned to the three conditions; then the next highest three and so forth.

\hypertarget{within-subject-experiments}{%
\subsection{Within-Subject Experiments}\label{within-subject-experiments}}

In a \textbf{within-subjects experiment} each participant is tested under all conditions. We can imagine the Tran and Lee \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} circumstance -- perhaps the participant shows up to Psych 101 experiments 3 weeks in a row and, each time, is somehow exposed to the high racial loading, low-racial loading, and control conditions (we'd need to be a little creative so it wouldn't be obvious).

An advantage of any within-subjects/repeated measures experiment is that it provides maximum control of extraneous participant variables (e.g., the participants all have the same SES, IQ, contextual variables).

\textbf{Order effects} are a big consideration in within-subjects experiments. Order effects occur when participants' responses are affected by the order of conditions. Still,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Carryover effects} could occur, in that the effect of the first experienced condition might impact outcomes in the next condition (e.g., the Tran and Lee participant experiences the high racial loading first and is more cautious at follow up; or withdraws from the study).
\item
  \textbf{Practice effects} occur when there is improved performance over time -- owing to practice.
\item
  \textbf{Fatigue effects} occur when there is deteriorating performance from tiredness or boredom.
\item
  \textbf{Context or contrast effects} occur when knowledge or experiences in a prior trial provide a contrast/context for responses in the next trial.
\end{itemize}

In Tran and Lee (as with many repeated measures experimental designs), we would want to counterbalance the order such that the order is randomly determined. In complete counterbalancing, an equal number of participants complete each possible of order of conditions.

Counterbalancing has two primary effects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Controls the order of conditions so that it is no longer a confounding variable
\item
  If there are carryover effects, it is possible to detect them (e.g., analyzing the data separately for each order to see whether it had an effect).
\end{itemize}

When I teach ANOVA, we progress through a series of ANOVA designs that correspond with the following research designs:

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{the-validity-family}{%
\section{The Validity Family}\label{the-validity-family}}

Earlier in the lecture, we reviewed six common \textbf{threats to internal validity} that were common to research designs that lacked pretty basic things: pre-test, random assignment, comparison groups. However, validity threats apply to all research designs.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Internal validity}: whether the evidence of a study supports the existence of a causal relationship among its variables. KEYWORD: CAUSALITY
\item
  \textbf{External validity}: whether the proposed relationship generalizes beyond characteristics of the study in which it was found. KEYWORD: GENERALIZATION
\item
  \textbf{Construct validity}: whether the interpretation of the causal relationship is accurate. KEYWORD: MEANING
  (Statistical conclusion validity: whether the facets of the quantitative evaluation were appropriate.
\item
  \textbf{Test/psychometric validity}: whether or not a particular measurement or observation measures what it purports to measure (much, much, more in psychometrics).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{defining-internal-validity-1}{%
\subsection{Defining ``Internal Validity''}\label{defining-internal-validity-1}}

\hypertarget{threats-to-internal-validity-1}{%
\subsubsection{Threats to Internal Validity}\label{threats-to-internal-validity-1}}

The purpose of an \textbf{experiment} is to show that two variables are statistically related and to do so in a way that supports the conclusion that the independent variable caused any observed differences in the dependent variable.

You've likely heard \textbf{correlation does not imply causation} -- thus in order to \textbf{infer causality} (we never ever ever ``prove''), we must design our study in such a way that we rule out \textbf{plausible rival hypotheses}. When we do, our study is high in \textbf{internal validity}. That is, the way the research was conducted supports the conclusion that the IV caused observable differences in the DV.

Kazdin's \citeyearpar{kazdin_research_2017} text identified a number of factors (outside of experimental design) that threaten internal validity:

\textbf{Selection Bias}: systematic differences in groups based upon the selection or assignment of subjects to experimental conditions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Remedy: random selection from the population; random assignment to groups; using difference tests on key variables (preliminary analyses)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diffusion or Imitation of Treatment}: the intervention given to one group may be provided accidentally to all or some subjects in the control group as well.
*Remedy: manipulation checks

\textbf{Special Treatment or Reactions of Controls}: in an investigation where the intervention, treatment, or program is administered to the experimental group, the no-treatment control group may also be accorded special attention, and thus react in unexpected ways.

\textbf{The Third Variable Problem}: two variables are correlated with each other because both are correlates of a third factor, even when there is no direct or indirect causal relationship between the first two \citep{reis_research_2000}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Here, the relationship between X and C is not causal
\item
  Because X and C are correlated, the changes in Y could be misattributed to X when they are actually caused by C
\item
  Thus, there is spurious correlation between X --\textgreater{} Y
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Experiment/ThirdVariable.png}
\caption{Illustration of the third variable problem}
\end{figure}

Therefore, we should ask, ``Do we have hidden variables?''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Remedy: random assignment; also when covariates are identified, test for moderating or mediating effects
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Experiment/ModMed.png}
\caption{Illustration of the third variable as moderating or mediating}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Attrition or Experimental Mortality}: subjects dropping out of the experiment over time, particularly when there is a \emph{differential} loss of subjects between groups.

*Remedy: know your pop/lit, start huge, do everything you can to keep your participants (within ethical limitations)

Boggs et al. \citeyearpar{boggs_outcomes_2005} examined outcomes of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) participants on the basis of their completion status (i.e., if they dropped out of treatment) one and three years later.

The narration of the article makes clear the problem of attrition in (a) the original study, (b) the follow-up study, and (c) treatment in general (hence they wanted to study the effect of attrition)!

So what to do about attrition:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Everything you can afford (and do not involve coercion) 0to minimize it

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Incentives
  \item
    Increasing incentives for longitudinal
  \item
    Pay participants (consider something equivalent to minimum wage)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Address it in the statistical analysis.
\end{itemize}

West et al. \citeyearpar{reis_causal_2000}(pp.~50-51) had a complete data set (simulated) where half of the participants were assigned to control and treatment conditions. The estimated \emph{true} difference was .5. The data was further simulated to assign some of the cases to be missing. Knowing the \emph{true} difference, the researchers analyzed the data with three different approaches to managing the missingness.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Typical analysis

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Toss out all participants in treatment group who do not receive treatment. This results in a biased estimate of causal effect; direction of bias is unknown. Using the typical analysis, the difference was estimated to be 1.045.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Intention to treat analysis

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Compare mean response of all participants assigned to treatment condition (regardless of whether they received treatment) with mean response of those in control condition. The intent-to-treat difference was estimated to be .34.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  CACE (complier average causal effect) analysis

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Create an unbiased estimate of treatment effect for those who receive treatment. It is a complicated statistic -- but the estimate is .5.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If you have access to the West et al. \citeyearpar{reis_causal_2000} chapter, it is worth looking at the table where this is demonstrated. In other lessons in the OER I offer additional approaches (i.e., multiple imputation, available item analysis) to managing missing data.

It happened to us!

Below are graphs from Scott Campanario's doctoral dissertation \citep{campanario_ignatian_2018, campanario_ignatian_2020} -- a random clinical trial evaluating three versions of SPU's Online Field Guide.

Control -- adjust to college only activities
Traditional -- Control + traditional career planning activities
Calling -- Traditional + Control + Ignatian discernment activities

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Experiment/Campanario.png}
\caption{Demonstration of problems caused by attrition}
\end{figure}

Attrition from pre (T1) to post (T2) as high. The graph on the left uses listwise/pairwise deletion (lose the whole case) if pre or post was missing. We expected that randomization would cause the three TA starting spots to be closer -- but they were not!

Why not? We aren't exactly sure, but it's likely that the students who persisted in the calling condition (the most demanding), were those who started higher on the outcome in the first place (career decision-making self-efficacy and purpose).

When we used multiple imputation to preserve case with missingness, it brought the means of the pre-test closer together and reflected our hypotheses (and likely the true state of the data) better. JUST TO BE CLEAR -- you can never really know the bias introduced by missingness -- but this is a story emphasizing why it is important to minimize it.

** \emph{One more Threat to Internal Validity} **

\textbf{Combination of Selection \& Other Threats}: selection of groups that are already formed prior to the experiment might lead to a combined confound of selection and some other threat to internal validity. The experience of one of the groups in the study (e.g., history, maturation) may differ systematically from the other group. The \emph{differential influence} of this threat among groups is referred to as an interaction with selection.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Remedy: random assignment to treatment groups
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{a-bit-about-the-remedies}{%
\subsection{A Bit about the Remedies}\label{a-bit-about-the-remedies}}

\textbf{Random selection}: Drawing subjects from a population in such a way that each member of the population has an equal probability of being drawn.

\textbf{Random assignment}: Allocating or assigning subjects to groups in such a way that the probability of each subject appearing in any of the groups is equal. This is usually accomplished by determining the group to which each subject is assigned by a table of random numbers (or now, on R or randomizer.org).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Comparison of Tx and control groups is only legitimate when the Tx and Control groups are equivalent in terms of all important background characteristics at pre-test.
\item
  Random assignment normally absolves concerns about this assumption.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{strategies-or-equating-non-equivalent-groups}{%
\subsection{Strategies or Equating Non-Equivalent Groups}\label{strategies-or-equating-non-equivalent-groups}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify all important covariates; attempt to discern hidden variables.
\item
  Measure each of these covariates with \emph{perfect reliability} (or statistically adjust for imperfection).
\item
  Specify a correct linear relationship b/t the pretest variables and outcome variable.
\item
  Demonstrate that pretest maturation rates do not differ in the Tx and Control groups. (Group * Pretest interactions are bad).
\item
  When each of these strategies has been successfully completed, the researcher has \emph{strong ignorability} (this is good; but achieving it is ``extraordinarily difficult and fraught with uncertainty'').

\section{Defining External Validity}\label{defining-external-validity}}

The \emph{generalizability} of the causal findings; can the same cause-effect relationship be obtained across different subjects, settings, methods. Three questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Robustness}: Can it be replicated in the face of variations of subject populations and settings (Milgram's 1963 move from Yale lab to a ``seedy office'')
\item
  \textbf{Ecological validity}: Is it representative of what happens in everyday life? Findings obtained with college students are interesting, but have no ecological validity until they have been demonstrated to occur in more representative circumstances.
\item
  \textbf{Relevance}: Does it matter? Akin to ecological validity -- is the finding related to events or phenomena that actually occur in the world? Are the results useful or applicable to solving problems and improving quality of life?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{threats-to-external-validty}{%
\subsection{Threats to External Validty}\label{threats-to-external-validty}}

\textbf{Sample characteristics}: The extent to which results be generalized to other persons who vary in age, race, ethnic background, education, etc.

\textbf{Stimulus characteristics}: The extent to which results can be extended across stimulus characteristics (i.e., features of the study) of the experiment.

\textbf{Contextual Characteristics}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Reactivity of experimental arrangements}: the influence of the subjects' awareness that they are participating in an investigation.
\item
  \emph{Multiple-treatment interference}: Drawing conclusions about a given treatment when it is evaluated in the context of other treatments.
\item
  \emph{Novelty effects}: effects of an intervention may, in part, depend upon their innovativeness or novelty.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assessment Characteristics}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Reactivity of assessment}: simply because subjects are aware that they are being assessed, they may alter their performance.
\item
  \emph{Test sensitization}: in designs where pre and posttest measures are completed, the pretest may sensitize the participants so that they are affected differently by the intervention (i.e., pretest sensitization).
\item
  \emph{Time of measurement and treatment effects}: the possibility that the effects of the experiment are demonstrated at the time of the testing, but might not generalize to a later point of time.
\end{itemize}

  \textbf{Plausibility}: an interpretation of the results of an investigation on the basis of some other influence than the one the investigator has studied or wishes to discuss.
\item
  \textbf{Parsimony}: directs us to select the simplest version or account of the data among the alternatives that are available.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{balancing-internal-and-external-validity}{%
\section{Balancing Internal and External Validity}\label{balancing-internal-and-external-validity}}

As a general rule, design features that make an experiment more sensitive as a test of the independent and dependent variables tend to limit the generality of the findings. Conversely, features of an experiment that enhance generality of the results tend to increase variability and to decrease the sensitivity of the experimental test (\citeyearpar{kazdin_research_2017}, p.~79)

Writing in the \emph{American Psychologist} in the 1980s, Mook's \citeyearpar{mook_defense_1983} statement emphasizes the importance of careful research design: ``I am afraid there is no alternative to thinking through, case by case, (a) what conclusion we want to draw and (b) whether the specifics of our sample or setting will prevent us from drawing it.'' (386)

\hypertarget{the-bubble-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{The Bubble Hypothesis}\label{the-bubble-hypothesis}}

Gelso \citeyearpar{gelso_research_1979} used ``bubble hypothesis'' as analogy for balancing internal and external validity. Gelso described the difficulty which arises when someone attempts to place a decal on a window and a bubble appears. When the bubble is depressed in one area, it arises somewhere else. The metaphor back to internal and external validity includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Inevitable trade-offs exist at all stages of research.
\item
  Knowledge is most powerfully advanced through the use of a variety of methods.
\item
  Rigor vs.~relevance

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Rigor: internal validity
  \item
    Relevance: external validity
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Key points in the balancing of internal and external validity have been made by the following scholars:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  As a priority internal validity is usually regarded as more important than, or at least logically prior in importance to external validity \citep{kazdin_research_2017}.
\item
  Some of the best and most helpful research begins with understanding the phenomena of interest, and studies with that focus may have very little external validity \citep{mook_defense_1983}.
\item
  Rarely can internal, external, (and construct) validity be properly addressed within the context of a single research design\ldots they require systematic, programmatic research studies that address a particular research question across different operations and research settings \citep{reis_research_2000}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{defining-construct-validity}{%
\section{Defining Construct Validity}\label{defining-construct-validity}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The extent to which a causal relationship could be generalized from the particular methods and operations of a specific study to the theoretical constructs and processes they are purported to represent.
\item
  Construct1 --\textgreater{} Operations --\textgreater{} Construct2
\item
  Specific operations/measures are merely partial representations of the theoretical constructs of interests (Brewer, 2000).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{threats-to-construct-validity}{%
\subsection{Threats to Construct Validity}\label{threats-to-construct-validity}}

\textbf{Unknown range problem}: the failure to specify precisely what levels of the IV are expected to be causally significant; and over what range of outcomes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Unknown range of stimulus variation
\item
  Unknown range of measurement
\end{itemize}

Because of these problems, it is difficult to determine whether a failure to confirm a predicted relationship is a failure of theory or a failure of operation.

\textbf{Attention and contact with the clients}: the intervention may have exerted its influence because of the attention provided rather than because of special characteristics unique to the intervention.

\textbf{Single Operations and Narrow Stimulus Sampling}: occurs when one cannot discern the construct of interest (i.e., treatment or types of description of treatment) from the conditions of its delivery (i.e., therapist or case vignette).

\textbf{Experimenter Expectancies}: the threat that expectancies, beliefs, and desires about the results on the part of the experimenter influences how the subjects perform; unintentional expectancy effects.

\textbf{Cues of the Experimental Situation}: seemingly ancillary factors associated with the intervention that may contribute to the results; ``demand characteristics of the experimental situation.''

\hypertarget{statistical-conclusion-validity}{%
\section{Statistical Conclusion Validity}\label{statistical-conclusion-validity}}

Defined as: those facets of the quantitative evaluation that influence the conclusions we reach about the experimental condition and its effect.

\hypertarget{threats-to-statistical-conclusion-validity}{%
\subsection{Threats to Statistical Conclusion Validity}\label{threats-to-statistical-conclusion-validity}}

\textbf{Low Statistical Power}: the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.

\textbf{Variability in the Procedures}: if variability is minimized, the likelihood of detecting a true difference between the treatments or treatment conditions and control conditions is increased.

\textbf{Subject Heterogeneity}: the greater the heterogeneity or diversity of subject characteristics, the less likelihood there will be to detect a difference between alternative conditions.

\textbf{Unreliability of Measures}: the extent to which the measures assess the characteristics of interest in a consistent fashion.

\textbf{Multiple Comparisons and Error Rates}: The more statistical tests that are performed, the more likely a chance difference will be found, even if there are no true differences between conditions (Type I error). Also called family-wise error, experiment wise-error.

Throughout the statistical portions of the ReCentering Psych Stats OER, I will consistently attend to statistical conclusion validity by attending to power analysis, statistical assumptions (and their violation/nonviolation), effect sizes, confidence intervals. In sum -- we look at the dashboard of metrics we learn from and about our analyses.

``As true experiments, single-case designs can demonstrate causal relations and can rule out or make implausible threats to validity with the same elegance of group research'' \citep[p.~273]{kazdin_research_2017}.

Three elements to the single case experiment:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Continuous Assessment}: Observations on multiple occasions over time prior to and during the period in which the intervention is administered.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a distinguishing difference between group (between-group) and single-case research. In the between-group research, there is usually a pre- and post- test given to a treatment and control group.
  \item
    provides several observations over time to allow the comparisons of interest.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Baseline Assessment}: Assessment for a period of time prior to implementation of the intervention.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    allows \emph{descriptive} (provides info about the extent of the client's problem) and \emph{predictive} (serves as basis for establishing predictions for performance) functions.
  \end{itemize}
\item

\hypertarget{experimental-design-strategies}{%
\section{Experimental Design Strategies}\label{experimental-design-strategies}}

\hypertarget{abab-designs}{%
\subsection{ABAB Designs}\label{abab-designs}}

A family of experimental arrangements in which continuous observations of performance are made over time for a given client (or group of clients). Over the course of the investigation, changes are made in the experimental conditions to which the client is exposed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  sometimes termed a reversal design because the phases are reversed to demonstrate the effect of the program.
\item
  causality is demonstrated by showing that the behavior reverts to or approaches the original baseline after the intervention is withdrawn or altered (during the second A phase).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    no reversal, no causality
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ethical issues:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Do we withdraw a treatment that's working well?
  \item
    Do we really shout for joy when withdrawal of the treatment results in deterioration of behavior?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{multiple-baseline-designs}{%
\subsection{Multiple Baseline Designs}\label{multiple-baseline-designs}}

Demonstrates the effectiveness of an intervention by showing that the behavior change accompanies introduction of the intervention at different points in time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  That is, once the intervention is presented, it need not be withdrawn or altered to reverse behavior to or near baseline levels. Thus, the clinical utility of the design is not limited by the problems of reverting behavior to pretreatment levels.
\item
  Key feature: evaluation of change across different baselines. The intervention is introduced to the different baselines at different points in time. Ideally, change occurs when the intervention is introduced in sequence to each of the baselines.
\item
  Each behavior is observed and graphed separately.
\item
  Many versions: Sometimes baselines may represent different behaviors, individuals, situations.
\item
  Ideally behaviors still exposed to the baseline condition do not change until the intervention is applied. If they do, it suggests that the intervention may not have been responsible for change. Rather, extraneous factors (history, testing) may have led to the change. Sometimes there are generalized effects; not ideal.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{changing-criteria-designs}{%
\subsection{Changing-Criteria Designs}\label{changing-criteria-designs}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Demonstrates the effect of an intervention by showing that behavior changes in increments to match a performance criterion.
\item
  A causal relation between an intervention and behavior is demonstrated if behavior matches a constantly changing criterion for performance over the course of treatment.
\item
  Once performance consistently meets the criterion, the criterion is made more stringent. The effect of the intervention is demonstrated if behavior matches a criterion as the criterion is changed.
\item
  Kazdin writes that the changing-criterion design is less powerful because the effects of extraneous events could account for a general increase or decrease in behavior. If the researcher can show a unilateral change in behavior over time, causality is better supported.

\subsection{Evaluating Single Case Study Designs}\label{evaluating-single-case-study-designs}}

The lecture reviews a series of graphs and describes how they connect back to the criteria. Owing to concerns of including copyrighted material in this printed copy, I am omitting those from this portion of the lesson.

These, though, are the notesthat go with each of the examples:

In the weight loss example (a graph showing a steady deline of weight over 5 weeks):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data is objective
\item
  Not continuous
\item
  Stability of problem not demonstrated with abaseline period of observation
\item
  Lacks multiple cases
\item
  Cannot rule out: history, maturation, testing, instrumentation, statistical regression toward the mean.
\end{itemize}

In the ``flatulent thoughts'' example, there is a period of baseline characterized by 12-21 thoughts per day with a good deal of variability. Once treatment starts, there is a variable progression downard. There is a break and then follow up observation where the thoughts remain low (5-7 a day).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data is objective
\item
  Continuous observation
\item
  Stability of problem is demonstrated
\item
  Immediate and marked effects demonstrated
\item
  Lacks multiple cases
\item
  Cannot rule out: history, maturation
\item
  Good controls for testing, instrumentation, statistical regression toward the mean
\end{itemize}

In the agoraphobia example there is a period of baseline where there was no actiity spent outside the house. There is a period of intervention where there is a substantial increase. Then aperiod of two-month followup with increased activy and agreat deal of variability. Then 18-months follow-up.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data is objective
\item
  Continuous observation
\item
  Stability of problem demonstrated
\item
  Lacks multiple cases
\item
  Cannot rule out: history, maturation,
\item
  Controls for testing, instrumentation, statistical regression toward the mean.
\end{itemize}

In the bedwetting example there is pretraining during the baseline period. There is an substantial and immediate drop in level when trainng begins and continued success that follows.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data is objective
\item
  Continuous observation
\item
  Stability of problem demonstrated
\item
  Contains multiple cases
\item
  Controls for history, maturation, testing, instrumentation, statistical regression toward the mean
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{case-based-time-series-analysis}{%
\section{Case-Based Time-Series Analysis}\label{case-based-time-series-analysis}}

``\ldots the \emph{practitioner-generated} case-based time-series design with baseline measurement fully qualifies as a true experiment and that it ought to stand alongside the more common group designs (e.g., RCT) as a viable approach to expanding our knowledge about whether, how, and for whom psychotherapy works.'' \citep[p.~77]{borckardt_clinical_2008}.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The Trouble with Interpreting \emph{N} = 1}{The Trouble with Interpreting N = 1}}\label{the-trouble-with-interpreting-n-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Neither visual inspection nor conventional statistics are to be relied on for analyzing single-patient time-series studies'' (p.~82).
\item
  The problem: auto-correlation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Observations are auto-correlated if the value of one observation depends (at least in part) on the value of one or more of the immediately preceding observations.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Simulation-modeling analysis} (SMA) as a technique for analyzing N = 1, time-series data
\end{itemize}

Borckardt et al. \citeyearpar{borckardt_clinical_2008} provided an example of pain intervention. Please refer to the tables and figures in the Borckardt et al.~article.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use Pearson r to calculate the Lag 1 autocorrelation. Result for baseline \& treatment: r = .85.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A Lag 1 correlation is the degree to which an observation at Time K predicts the observation that comes immediately after it (at Time K + 1). The Lag 1 correlation is simply the correlation between each data point and the point immediately following it.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The research question: Is the decrease in pain from baseline (M = 7.78) through tx (M = 3.29) statistically significant?
\item
  SMA says yes: r (44) = -.69, p = .049, even after controlling for autocorrelation.
\end{itemize}

SMA answers the question, ``mere random variation of pain reports is an unlikely explanation of the phase difference from baseline to treatment, EVEN AFTER controlling for autocorrelation (that is, even after autocorrelation, there is systematic variation in the data and we will attribute it to our intervention).

Another example: What would behavioral activation theory suggest about the relationship between mood and social engagement? Cross-lagged correlations can be used to determine the direction of change. In this case, does change in mood precede behavioral activation, or vice versa? The article includes three examples, an instructional appendix, and a \href{http://clinicalresearcher.org}{link} to free SMA software.

Kazdin retells the case of clinical that asked clients to self-assess at each visit. Kazdin's text had three graphs -- two of established measures and a third of the ``G-scale,'' which represented Gloria's self-rating of progress.

A copy of the scale is shown in the lecture and available in Kazdin's text. Consider these questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How did the Clinician attempt to systematic ally evaluate the Clinical Practice?
\item
  How are evaluation/methods issues similar/different to clinical/case conceptualization issues.
\item
  How credible is the G scale?
\item
  Can you imagine doing this in YOUR practice?
\item

Morgan and Morgan \citeyearpar{morgan_single-participant_2001} addressed the push and pull between statistical/group designs and the single case design.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Role of \emph{variability} is the key.
\item
  \emph{Variability} is an irreducible property of natural phenomena (Gould 1996).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Empirical statistical studies seek to neutralize variance. We owe this to Plato who saw variation as accidental; ideals lived on a higher plane.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{N} = 1 studies \emph{exploit variability}, to provide pivotal information about the impact of the IV over time. We owe this to Darwin's grand unification theory (genetic variation serves as the raw materials on which selective pressures can operate over time).

Qualitative research methods is a huge topic. There are a number of different approaches (that span an array of philosophies of science) and so is impossible to address properly in an hour-long review. In this short time, we will start with a bit of qualitative history that applies directly to pscyhology. I will demonstrate one qualitative method -- \emph{Naturalistic Inquiry} (which was an early method whose ideas are reflected in other approaches) in a study I led a few years ago.

As we get closer to psychology, there have been several important publications that have influenced our processes. In an editorial in the \emph{Academy of Management Journal}, Gephart \citeyearpar{gephart_qualitative_2004} provided some guidelines for those conducting qualitative research in Industrial-Organizational psychology. As a one who reviews a number of qualitative methods, I agree with these and have added one additional guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``one off'' -- embedded in a larger research program?
\item
  Adequate lit review?
\item
  Explicit statement of goals, objectives, research questions?
\item
  Clear \& thorough construct definition?
\item
  Sufficiently specified methodology?
\item
  Narrative thread evident in discussion/conclusion?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Plus} (mine):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A clear location in philosophy of science that drives the method?

Below is a sketch of the culture shock model that is often used to prepare individuals for study, work, and relocation abroad. My husband and I were exposed to this model in pre-departure preparation for our expatriation. Curious about it, I began a longitudinal (5 waves across 1 year) examination of the first-year adaptation of female, expatriate spouses, in Ankara, Turkey.

As I describe in the lecture, the study was mixed methods. The participants (\emph{N} = 32) completed measures and interviews at each of the waves. Our quantitative analyses suggested no predictable change over time.

This was true for mental health, alcohol use, and marital satisfaction.

In this project we probably leaned a little \emph{positivist} in that we had two teams who themed the data separately. These themes are captured in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also captures the participant ID number, the place in the transcript, and the wave (alphabetical).

\includegraphics{images/Qualitative/case_report.jpg}
\#\#\# Grand Member Check

After the case study was drafted (not final, just drafted), we sent it to \emph{stakeholders} (some of the research participants and others with a ``stake in the phenomena'') to get their impressions. We asked, ``What sounds right?'' ``What did we miss?'' ``Is this true to your experience?'' We would have liked to have held these meetings in person, but due to the nature of repatriation, we asked for feedback in e-mail responses.

Finally, we sent all of our materials to an expert in qualitative research methods who was aware of the study, but neither a research participant nor member of the research team.

This lesson presume that you have not had a psychometrics course. In the particular research methods/statistics sequence I teach, psychometrics is the last in the series. This psychometrics primer is intended to demonstrate how to gather and interpret basic reliability and validity information. A lesson later in the ReCentering Psych Stats OER guides you through scoring your measures and conducting the basic psychometric evaluations (alpha coefficients).

But first, a trivia question. Why is ``reliability'' abbreviated \(r_{xx}\) and ``validity'' abbreviated \(r_{xy}\)? The answer is at the end of the lesson.

In this, students find write-ups of 12 measures, mapping the parts-n-pieces of the write-ups, and then creating their own recipe/outline for how to draft descriptions of measures in future empirical papers.

\hypertarget{classical-test-theory}{%
\section{Classical Test Theory}\label{classical-test-theory}}

Classical test theory (CTT) is based on Spearman's (1904) true-score model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an observed score is conceived of as consisting of two components -- a true component and an error component
\item
  \(X = T + E\)
\end{itemize}

Where
X = the fallible, observed score, obtained under ideal or perfect conditions of measurement (these conditions never exist)
T = the true score, and
E = random error.

\textbf{Measurement} is the assignment of scores to individuals so that the scores represent some characteristic of the individuals \citep{jhangiani_research_2019}; measurement of psychological constructs is, \textbf{psychometrics}.

While measurement does not require any specific instrument or process, there must be some systematic procedure for assigning scores so that they represent the characteristics of interest.

Psychological \textbf{constructs} cannot be observed directly -- they often represent tendencies to think, feel, or behave in certain ways and they often involve internal processes.

Examples: intelligence, The Big Five, attitudes

We can define constructs two ways:

\textbf{Conceptual definition}: describes the behaviors and internal processes that make up that construct, along with how it relates to other variables.

\textbf{Operational definition}: describes precisely how the construct is to be measured.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Self-report}: participants report their own thoughts, feelings, actions
\item
  \textbf{Behavioral measures}: some aspect of participants' behavior is observed and recorded. This could range from a highly structured lab task or a more natural setting.
\item
  \textbf{Physiological measures}: involve recording any of a wide variety of physiological processes including heart rate/blood pressure, galvanic skin response, hormone levels, electrical activity, and blood flow in the brain.
\end{itemize}

For any given construct/measures there can be a variety of operational definitions. \textbf{Converging operations} occurs when scores based on several different operational definitions are closely related to each other and produce similar patterns of results. This constitutes good evidence that the construct is being effectively measured.

S. S. Stevens (1946) was among the first to suggest that the type of score assigned to individuals communicates more or less quantitative information about the variable of interest. He suggested four different levels of measurement. In the psychometric context it is critical that we know this measurement scale (a synomym).

\emph{R recognizes at least 15 different types of data. Below I note the structure of the data you are most likely to see/use with each of the measurement scales \citep{noauthor_rpubs_nodate}(RPubs - R Intro Theory of Measurement, n.d.)}.

\textbf{Nominal} (in R, factor): used for categorical variables and the scores are category labels; not considered to be quantitative.

\textbf{Ordinal} (in R, integer {[}whole numbers, no decimal point{]}): assigning a score so that it represents the rank order of the individuals. Allows us to know if individuals are the same or different -- and if who is higher or lower. One problem with ordinal scales is that we cannot presume the difference between two levels on an ordinal scale to be the same as the difference between two other levels (the equal interval problem).

\textbf{Interval} (in R, integer or numeric): assigning scores using numerical scales in which intervals have the same interpretation throughout. In Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature scales, the difference between 30 and 40 degrees represents the same temperature difference as the difference between 80 and 90 degrees (each 10 degree interval has the same kinetic energy of molecules). One problem with interval scales is the absence of a true zero point. Therefore we cannot make statements like, ``X is twice as large as Y.''

\textbf{Ratio} (in R, numeric): has an equal interval scale plus a true zero point. Counts (e.g., cigarettes smoked, number of siblings, money) are ratio scales.

\hypertarget{alternate-equivalent-form-reliability}{%
\subsubsection{Alternate (Equivalent)-Form Reliability}\label{alternate-equivalent-form-reliability}}

\subsubsection{Split-Half Method}\label{split-half-method}}

A measure of internal consistency; give test once. Score two equivalent halves of test (e.g., odd items and even items); correct correlation between halves to fit whole test by Spearman-Brown formula.
``half-length test reliability estimate.''

\hypertarget{internal-consistency-1}{%
\subsubsection{Internal consistency}\label{internal-consistency-1}}

\textbf{Coefficient alpha}: Measure of internal consistency for scales with Likert-type scaling (i.e., 1 to 5). Give test once. Score total test. Apply Cronbach's Alpha formula.

This is the most common form of reliability. Synonyms are: internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha, alpha. We will learn to calculate these in multivariate, but then examine them critically in psychometrics. They are not without controversy; one of the big problems is that more items (\textasciitilde14 items) almost guarantee a satisfactory alpha ( ≥ .80).

\textbf{KR-20s}: can provide internal consistency estimates for dichotomously scored items.

\hypertarget{interrater-reliabiliy}{%
\subsubsection{Interrater Reliabiliy}\label{interrater-reliabiliy}}

\end{itemize}

Validity is the appropriateness of the interpretation of the results of an assessment procedure for a given group of individuals, not to the procedure itself.

\begin{itemize}

\hypertarget{construct-validty}{%
\subsubsection{Construct Validty}\label{construct-validty}}

\textbf{Constructs} are broad categories, derived from the common features shared by directly observable behavioral variables. They are theoretical entities and not directly observable. \textbf{Construct validity}, then, is the fundamental and all-inclusive validity concept, insofar as it specifies what the test measures.

Construct validity was introduced in 1954 in the first edition of APA's testing standards. It is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the extent to which the test may be said to measure a theoretical construct or trait
\item
  focused on the role of psychological theory in test construction and on the need to formulate hypotheses that can be supported or refuted in the validation process.
\item
  involves the gradual accumulation of information from a variety of sources that supports its construct validation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{criterion-related-validity}{%
\subsubsection{Criterion Related Validity}\label{criterion-related-validity}}

\textbf{Criterion related validity} involves correlating the test scores with a relevant present (concurrent) or future (predictive) outcomes.

\textbf{Concurrent validity} occurs when the criterion is collected approximately the same time as the scores. Examples might include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Correlation of BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) score with the diagnosis from a licensed psychologist
\item
  Correlation of performance self-assessment with a supervisor rating
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Predictive validity} occurs when the criterion is collected after a specified time interval. Examples might include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Correlation of a screening test with future diagnosis or occurrence of a screened-for event (e.g., suicide, disease, diagnosis)
\item
  Correlation of employment screening test score with supervisor's performance evaluation 6 months after the hire
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{convergent-and-discriminant-validity}{%
\subsubsection{Convergent and Discriminant Validity}\label{convergent-and-discriminant-validity}}

We expect ``moderately high'' correlations (\textbf{convergence}) of our new test and similarly earlier tests (e.g., correlation of a quantitative reasoning test with a subsequent grade in a math course)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If our correlations are ``too high,'' then we are creating needless duplication of a test (unless our test is cheaper or shorter).
\item
  We also need to show that it does NOT correlate significantly with variables from which it should differ (discriminant).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    low and insignificant correlation of the quantitative reasoning test with scores on a reading comprehension test
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The multitrait-multimethod demonstrates convergent and discriminant validity.The classic image used to illustrate this matrix can be found \href{https://conjointly.com/kb/multitrait-multimethod-matrix/}{here}
  \citep{trochim_multitrait-multimethod_nodate}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structural-validity}{%
\subsubsection{``Structural'' Validity}\label{structural-validity}}

\textbf{Structural validity} uses exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to understand the dimensionality of the measure.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example, IQ is composed of 2 (or more) factors (e.g., verbal and performance)
\item
  Provides support (or not) for using total or subscale scores.
\end{itemize}

What follows are my personal markups of the measures sections of three manuscripts. Each is well-written and each serves the purpose the research with which it was associated.

I review these so that you can begin to

The first example is from Tran and Lee's \citeyearpar{tran_you_2014} stuy. This was a brief report and instruments/measures were not presented in an itemized way.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Appraisal and evaluation were 6-items each and were administered pre and post.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The reliability measure of internal consistency (alpha coefficient) was .80 at pre-test; and .89 and .85 at post-test.
  \item
    Because they are 6-items each, with each item summed (or mean), I would suggest it is appropriately used as an interval-scale measure.
  \item
    No other reliability or validity information is given.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  Single-items measure enjoyability, similarity, accuracy, and how-much-longer.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There is no reliability or validity information is provided about them.
  \item
    Because they are single-items, they will likely be treated as interval-level, but are probably more appropriately categorized as ordinal.

  No indication of scaling; assume it is Likert; interval scaling.
\item
  Two items were negatively worded so would need to be res-cored.
\item

\section{Practice Problem}\label{practice-problem}}

The suggested practice problem for this chapter is to create your own ``penultimate psychometric template.'' The goal of this project is to expose you (deeply and interactively) with a variety of write-ups.

Please locate 12 write-ups of measures used in research projects.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Include at least 4 write-ups (but no more than 6) of ONE measure.
\item
  The remaining 8 write-ups can be from different measures or same measures.
\end{itemize}

This assignment happens in two stages. First, you will map each of the measures you select (i.e., parallel to diagramming a sentence). Second, looking across the write-ups of those measures, you will create your own template (i.e., a recipe card) for how you will write up a measures in your own papers.

Here's an example of how I would map the following write-up of the Mental Health Inventory used in Bikos et al. \citeyearpar{bikos_repeated_2007}

\hypertarget{some-context}{%
\section{Some Context}\label{some-context}}

APA creates (via task forces) and approves (via a process involving a task force, divisional input, and multiple layers of review, finally approved by the Council of Representatives) a variety of \href{https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines}{professional practice guidelines} that are freely and publicly available.

There are a couple of distinctions that are important when considering the information provided in the guidelines:

First, are they \emph{aspirational} or \emph{mandatory}?

• Standards (like the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct) are mandatory
• Guidelines are aspirational and informative regarding practice considerations.

Second, are they for the \emph{practitioner} or the \emph{client}:

• Treatment guidelines are client-focused and address intervention-specific recommendations for clinical populations or conditions.
• Practice guidelines are practitioner-focus and provide guidance for clinical practice, education, research, and consultation

The \emph{Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change for Psychologists} were first released in \citep{american_psychological_association_guidelines_2002}.

In recent years, with explicit acknowledgment that the U.S. is increasingly diverse and that we are at a ``different period in time,'' multiple guidelines have been produced and are guided by a foundation of intersectionality. Thus, the 2017 multicultural guidelines \citep{task_force_on_re-envisioning_the_multicultural_guidelines_for_the_21st_century_multicultural_2017}:

• Are conceptually grounded in a Bronfenbrenner style model with five concentric circles: microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem,
• Recognize three dynamic process that influence the model: power/privilege, tensions, fluidity.
• Highlight intersectionality that is ``shaped by the multiplicity of the individual's social contexts.''

\includegraphics{images/JEDI/Bronfenbrenner.png}
Below, I list each of the six guidelines and outline the concrete, practical recommendations associated within the applications to research subsection \citep{task_force_on_re-envisioning_the_multicultural_guidelines_for_the_21st_century_multicultural_2017}. These are my paraphrases -- and, because I provided the citation in this paragraph, I do not provide secondary citations. Also, in many of these subsections the Task Force makes recommendations for research topics. I do not list those.

\textbf{Guideline 1. Psychologists seek to recognize and understand that identity and self-definition are fluid and complex and that the interaction between the two is dynamic. To this end, psychologists appreciate that intersectionality is shaped by the multiplicity of the individual's social contexts.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Research often looks ``downstream'' for cause (i.e., individual behavior that may be associated with a social category membership) when we can also look ``upstream'' for macro societal processes that define systems of social inequality (laws, cultural mores, institutional practices, public policies).
\item
  Quantitative and qualitative can be used effectively to answer some of these questions.
\item
  That said, qualitative and/or mixed methods may be more sensitive to social complexities because of the use of open-ended versus checkboxes; grounded/emergent rather than a priori theory.
\item
  If engaged in scholar-activism or participatory action research, be mindful that the project isn't just serving those on the ``scholar side of the equation.''
\item
  Consider self-identification of demographic data. Recognize multiple identities.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 2. Psychologists aspire to recognize and understand that as cultural beings, they hold attitudes and beliefs that can influence their perceptions of and interactions with others as well as their clinical and empirical conceptualizations. As such, psychologists strive to move beyond conceptualizations rooted in categorical assumptions, biases, and/or formulations based on limited knowledge about individuals and communities.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Be cognizant and responsive to how design, methodology, and data analysis are shaped by personal worldviews and assumptions.
\item
  Culturally informed empirical studies strive for collaboration (valuing the perspectives and sociocultural locations and identities of research participants) and self-reflexivity on the part of the researcher.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 3. Psychologists strive to recognize and understand the role of language and communication through engagement that is sensitive to the lived experience of the individual, couple, family, group, community, and/or organizations with whom they interact. Psychologists also seek to understand how they bring their own language and communication to these interactions.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Culturally adapt measures, research questions, practices (not stated in the article, but {[}Byrne, 2016{]} outlines an entire process of culturally adapting measures).
\item
  Informed consent should be provided in the participants' primary language.
\item
  Incorporate members of the community in all aspects of the research planning and implementation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 4. Psychologists endeavor to be aware of the role of the social and physical environment in the lives of clients, students, research participants, and/or consultees.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A 1946 call for community action research and practice remains the article's recommendation.
\item
  Not mentioned in the article, multi-level (statistics) approaches that can accommodate individual- and contextual- level inputs in the same analysis can be useful.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 5. Psychologists aspire to recognize and understand historical and contemporary experiences with power, privilege, and oppression. As such, they seek to address institutional barriers and related inequities, disproportionalities, and disparities of law enforcement, administration of criminal justice, educational, mental health, and other systems as they seek to promote justice, human rights, and access to quality and equitable mental and behavioral health services.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Leverage methodological diversity. For example, pair quantitative methods with qualitative, discovery-oriented, and/or community-based participatory approaches.
\item
  Establish relationships with community partners to collect and analyze data with and from those communities.
\item
  As more research is published, employ meta-analysis to draw broader conclusions.
\item
  Comparative research between dominant and non-dominant help-seeking individuals may be used to better understand differences in health care and, in particular, identify unique demographic patterns that correlate with mental health disparities.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 6. Psychologists seek to promote culturally adaptive interventions and advocacy within and across systems, including prevention, early intervention, and recovery.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Foster the development of culture-centered interventions.
\item
  Seek to include research participants who are diverse across multicultural variables.
\item
  Develop/adapt research measures for multicultural contexts.
\item
  Document the evaluation/adaptation of evidence based treatments (EBTs) to culturally and linguistically diverse contexts.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 7. Psychologists endeavor to examine the profession's assumptions and practices within an international context, whether domestically or internationally based, and consider how this globalization has an impact on the psychologist's self-definition, purpose, role, and function.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Contribute to a global helping paradigm that links psychology, psychotherapy, and indigenous healing across national boundaries.
\item
  International communities may have no (or different) regulatory standards. In this case, consult with local NGOs, health clinics, and stakeholders to abide by both by U.S. (IRB) and local standards.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 8. Psychologists seek awareness and understanding of how developmental stages and life transitions intersect with the larger biosociocultural context, how identity evolves as a function of such intersections, and how these different socialization and maturation experiences influence worldview and identity.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pay close attention and inform themselves of the intersectional considerations that participants present. How do these influence interpretations of findings regarding self, identity, group membership, and the consistency of presentation across groups of a psychological phenomena or concept?
\item
  A qualitative component may help unravel this.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 9. Psychologists strive to conduct culturally appropriate and informed research, teaching, supervision, consultation, assessment, interpretation, diagnosis, dissemination, and evaluation of efficacy as they address the first four levels of the Layered Ecological Model of the Multicultural Guidelines.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Recognize the limited generalizability of random clinical trials (RCTs); this may reduce the effectiveness of evidence based treatments (EBTs) with diverse groups.
\item
  Review culturally adapted interventions or evidence of fidelity to the original approach.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Guideline 10. Psychologists actively strive to take a strength-based approach when working with individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations that seeks to build resilience and decrease trauma within the sociocultural context.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Determine and employ local definitions of resilience and other strengths-based outcomes.
\item
  Recognize how these definitions change as a function of intersecting identities (e.g., sex, gender roles).
\item
  And again: quant + qual.
\end{itemize}

The following research-related guideline is from the \emph{Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Clients} \citep{american_psychological_association_guidelines_2012}.

\textbf{Guideline 21. In the use and dissemination of research on sexual orientation and related issues, psychologists strive to represent results fully and accurately and to be mindful of the potential misuse or misrepresentation of research findings.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Be aware of the potential influence of overt and covert bias
\item
  Exercise care that reports are thorough and that limitations are fully disclosed and discussed
\item
  Remember that there are subgroups within LGBTQ+ communities that are not included in research samples; take their absence into consideration when applying/discussing findings
\item
  Be extra careful when citing/quoting research findings from third parties
\item
  Avoid false or deceptive statements; accurately publish research results
\item
  Remember that media outlets lack psychological training; emphasize to journalists the complexity and limitations of research findings
\end{itemize}

Another research-specific guideline is from the \emph{Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People} \citep{american_psychological_association_guidelines_2015}.

\textbf{Guideline 15. Psychologists respect the welfare and rights of TGNC participants in research and strive to represent results accurately and avoid misuse or misrepresentation of findings.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Provide a range of options for capturing demographic information about TGNC people so that TGNC people may be included and accurately represented. One group recommends

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    First asking sex assigned at birth
  \item
    Following with a question about gender identity
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Because the TGNC population may be hard to reach (geographically dispersed, diverse, stigmatized, hidden), consider collaborative research methods such as participatory action research in which the members are integrally involved.
\item
  Be cautious with media. Journalists may have limited knowledge about the scientific method and there is potential for misinterpretation, exploitation, sensationalization.

\hypertarget{the-crises}{%
\section{The Crises}\label{the-crises}}

\hypertarget{the-replicability-crisis}{%
\subsection{The Replicability Crisis}\label{the-replicability-crisis}}

\textbf{Replicability} is re-performing the experiment with new data. Summarizing results of replicability studies, Stevens \citeyearpar{stevens_replicability_2017} noted the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In medicine, only 25\% of previously published studies were able to replicate/confirm statistically significant effects.
\item
  In behavioral economics, 61\%
\item
  In psychology, 36\% (when 97\% of the original studies did so)
\end{itemize}

What accounts for these discrepancies?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Differences in design and methods between the original and replication studies;
\item
  False negatives (Type II error) in the replication;
\item
  False positives (Type I error) in the original study;
\item
  Confirmation bias at any step in the original study, such as

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Developing tests that attempt to confirm rather than disconfirm hypothesis
  \item
    Perceiving behaviors in a manner that align with expectations (as opposed to outcomes),
  \item
    Reporting the confirmatory (and ignoring the disconfirmatory) results (p-hacking)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The file-drawer problem: inability to publish results (original or replication) with non-significant results.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    24\% of all NIH-funded trials aimed at evaluating the efficacy of psychological treatments for major depression were not published; when included in meta-analyses, this led to a 25\% reduction in the estimated effect of psychotherapy (Hengartner, 2018).
  \item
    For CBT-specific trials, when unpublished trials were included in a meta-analysis, there was a 37\% reduction in the estimated efficacy of the intervention.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-reproducibility-crisis}{%
\subsection{The Reproducibility Crisis}\label{the-reproducibility-crisis}}

``An article {[}\ldots{]} in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures'' \citep{buckheit_wavelab_1995}.

Reproducibility is reperforming the same analysis with the same code, using a different analyst.

In most published research, this is not possible. In a survey of 441 biomedical articles (2000 to 2014), only one was fully reproducible.

\hypertarget{open-science-what-why}{%
\section{Open Science: What \& Why}\label{open-science-what-why}}

Core principles of science (at a time when the integrity of science is being questioned) include \citep{alter_responsible_2018}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Research transparency}: the methods are described with sufficient detail such that the study can be replicated; also codebooks, analytic/processing scripts (including those used to create tables and figures) are available
\item
  \textbf{Reproducibility}: verify the published findings with the same dataset.
\item
  \textbf{Replicability}: find similar share with a different/new data set.
\item
  \textbf{Data sharing}: some version of the data (raw/primary, de-identified, perhaps blurred) available freely or through an application/vetting process
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-transparency}{%
\subsection{Research Transparency}\label{research-transparency}}

Alter and Gonzalez \citeyearpar{alter_responsible_2018} suggested that research transparency includes more than sharing of data. Research transparency also includes the procedures used to create and analyze the data. Why?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data are often refined, corrected, and manipulated before analysis. These steps may be part of the process that makes a statistically significant finding possible; that is, other approaches to scrubbing/scoring data will produce different (unstable) results.\\
\item
  Transparency requires that these steps be clearly articulated -- in order and with all details of the process.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{who-owns-the-data}{%
\subsection{Who owns the data?}\label{who-owns-the-data}}

It depends -- and is worth careful consideration.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Institutions:
  -- While the PI is often considered to be the custodian/steward of the data, it is often contractually understood that the institution owns data when it is externally funded (e.g., NIH, NSF).
\item
  The principal investigator (PI)/lab? Maybe. Even in the absence of ownership the P.I. is likely the responsible party.
\item
  The community? At least as co-owner? From community participatory action or critical-ideological approaches, the community should likely have a say in data management.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{open-science-where}{%
\section{Open Science: Where}\label{open-science-where}}

\hypertarget{data-repositories}{%
\subsection{Data Repositories:}\label{data-repositories}}

Institutions that make commitments to preserve, maintain, and distribute data over time. They also make data citable by assigning persistent identifiers (e.g., the DOI in journal articles).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Domain specific}: provide services for a specific field. Focus on limited types of data and invest heavily in curating it for reuse.\\
  -- Examples: ICPSR (quantitative data for social and behavioral research), Databrary (videos used by developmental psychologists).
\item
  \textbf{General}: serve a broad range of disciplines and provide fewer data curation services. Designed to be self-service in that the depositor provides documentation and meta-data (e.g., ``data about data'' such as details in a codebook).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mendeley, Figshare, Dataverse
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Institutional}: operated by libraries with a broad mission to document and preserve all the research produced by faculty, staff, students. The scope and services varies by institutions. Large universities hire staff with data management, documentation, and preservation services.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{journals-supplemental-files}{%
\subsection{Journals: Supplemental files}\label{journals-supplemental-files}}

Many journals provide the option of uploading supplemental files. These could be a variety of things: testing/interview protocols, supplemental tables/figures, and data/meta-data.

\hypertarget{open-science-who-are-the-stakeholders}{%
\section{Open Science: Who are the Stakeholders?}\label{open-science-who-are-the-stakeholders}}

\hypertarget{groups}{%
\subsection{Groups}\label{groups}}

Research data have the potential to harm individuals and their communities \citep{ross_ethical_2018}. We generally apply the ethical principle of beneficence to the individual; but we are wise to think of it as it applies to communities as well. Consider the case where a research team collected blood samples from members of the Havasupai tribe for a diabetes study. Later it was discovered that samples had been shared with other researchers to study issues including inbreeding, human migration, and schizophrenia. Separate from whether individual participants were identified, this resulted in social and psychological harm to the tribe as a whole.

\hypertarget{individual-research-participants}{%
\subsection{Individual Research participants}\label{individual-research-participants}}

A substantial objection to sharing research data is that confidential information about research participants will be protected.

Evaluating harm from disclosure risks can be considered bidimensionally:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
& Probability of reidentification \\
\midrule
\endhead
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
Potential harm & Lo & Hi \\
\midrule
\endhead
Lo & & \\
Hi & & \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Consider the following examples in each of the quadrants.

Low potential for harm:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Opinions in a national poll, perception tasks in an experimental setting
\end{itemize}

High potential for harm:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mental health, drug use, criminal activity, sexual behavior
\end{itemize}

Hi probability of re-identification:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Direct identifiers (name, phone number, SSN)
\item
  Geospatial locations
\item
  Longitudinal designs with repeated interviews and contextual info (grade, school)
\end{itemize}

Some data cannot be completely anonymized without destroying its research value.

\hypertarget{the-common-rule}{%
\subsection{The Common Rule}\label{the-common-rule}}

The \emph{Common Rule} (Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects \citep{noauthor_federal_2009} is the chartering document guiding IRB activity.

The chartering document for institutional review boards (IRB) defines minimal risk as it relates to research endeavors. To the degree that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort in the research activity does not exceed those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during a routine physical or psychological evaluation, data can be shared without any additional precautions.

Historically, informed consent language said something like, ``Your data will only be available to members of our research team\ldots at the end it will be destroyed.'' The new version of the Common Rule \citep{protections_ohrp_revised_2017} includes guidelines for ``broad consent'' which covers storage and future secondary research with data that includes identifiable protection. The Common Rule suggests that participants should be given a general description of the types of research that may be conducted with the information collected from them and informed about the types of identifiable private information that will be kept and the types of researchers who may have access to that information.

This is all emerging -- dynamic consent has been suggested as a way to allow patients to decide who can use their health data for research. Patients who have provided samples (e.g., blood, DNA) get texts/surveys through their phones to grant/deny consent for new uses.

\hypertarget{data-creators}{%
\subsubsection{Data creators}\label{data-creators}}

Among a variety of scientists, an NSF funded study reported that psychologists were the most negative about data sharing (Martone et al., 2018), with 30\% indicating that data should be shared. What are the concerns \citep{martone_data_2018}?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fear for reputation: making errors and being called out.
\item
  Fear of being scooped: someone else will beat me to my next question.
\item
  Fear of liability: release of primary data for certain participants might lead to prosecution.
\item
  It's a lot of work. I have to do this, too!?!?
\item
  My data are far too complex/sophisticated to be understood by anyone else on the planet.
\item
  My data are not useful beyond the purposes I have planned for them.
\item
  How will the field develop/evolve if we just reanalyze old data?
\end{itemize}

Yet, there are counterpoints \citep{martone_data_2018}:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 0\tabcolsep) * \real{1.00}}@{}}
\toprule
``The issue of who is harmed by sharing data needs to be balanced against who is harmed by not sharing data?'' (p.~117) \\
\midrule
\endhead
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.18}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.82}}@{}}
\toprule
The Issue & A Counterpoint \\
\midrule
\endhead
Reputation/Liability & What if errors (if any) are undiscovered? Or findings are spurious (and only because of biased ways of data preparation)? \\
Being Scooped & Curiously, in microbiology, the original data creators tended to publish two years after the data were made publically available; other authors tended to publish five to six years after the data were made available. \\
Unrewarded effort & ``If data are essential products of scholarship, those who create data must be appropriately acknowledged and rewarded'' (\citep{alter_responsible_2018}, p.~153). \\
Data isn't useful beyond the single project & Martone \citep{martone_data_2018} recounted the results of the VISION-SCI project where the scientific community made individual data sets available (even those with NS effect -- ``file-drawer'' and ``background'' data). Although individual studies (usually with restricted samples) produced unstable and inconsistent findings, the combined data provided a ``fuller sampling of \ldots the `syndromic space'\,'' (p.~114) and resulted in robust predictive models. \\
The field will stagnate with no new data being collected & Even the most amazing, longitudinal sets such as the High School and Beyond longitudinal set that has been used in so many examples \citep{noauthor_high_nodate}(High School \& Beyond, National Educational Longitudinal Set) become obsolete and are replaced by newer samples and improved measures/techniques. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Other practical considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors may request (and journals may grant) an embargo period ranging from a few months to two years (or at least until the article is published) before the data is released \citep{martone_data_2018}.
\item
  When published data are part of larger data sets, only the variables used in the study are the only ones required to be made available.
\item
  ``Citations'' are the basis of scholarly recognition. PIs are wise to use a depository that will provide a formal citation (5 elements: author, title, date, publisher/distributor, location; with persistent identifier) such that the data will be included in the reference list.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When we make data (and/or script/code) available in a repository -- we should list it on our resume/CV!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Similarly, scripts/code for all aspects of data management, analysis, and manipulation can be formally prepared, archived, and cited.

\hypertarget{open-science-how}{%
\section{Open Science: How}\label{open-science-how}}

\hypertarget{regarding-research-transparency}{%
\subsection{Regarding research transparency}\label{regarding-research-transparency}}

Establish (now, while you are just learning) the regular practice of a standard research workflow. It should

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Be ordered, such that it maps along with the results section of the published manuscript.
\item
  Contain all of the script/code/syntax (in our case, the .rmd file) that does everything: defines variables, cleans data, includes/excludes data, manages missingness, scores scales/subscales, tests assumptions, runs the analyses, creates figures/tables.
\item
  Include narration of what you are doing and your rationale for doing so.
\item
  And also a ``bug log''; a document that notes errors and corrections.
\item
  This should not be a ``disorganized set of statistical commands'' (Alter \& Gonzalez, 2018, p.~148)
\end{itemize}

Alter and Gonzalez \citeyearpar{alter_responsible_2018} went further to suggest that the script/code should be keyed to the final publication (e.g., page or paragraph number).

\hypertarget{regarding-data-ownership}{%
\subsection{Regarding data ownership}\label{regarding-data-ownership}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Get clarification on responsibilities and restrictions regarding \emph{the} data that was used (note I did not write \emph{your} data) in your projects (institutional, legal {[}FERPA, HIPAA, The Common Rule{]}).
\item
  When starting a new project, include as much detail as possible in the IRB application and informed consent about all the possible uses for data.
\end{itemize}

Below is an excerpt from a recent IRB application that projects how data might be used (credit to Tom Carpenter, PhD, for examples of language to use in the informed consent).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 0\tabcolsep) * \real{1.00}}@{}}
\toprule
Confidentiality \\
\midrule
\endhead
The data we are using is completely de-identified and is already available to instructors as well as their chairs, deans, and members of tenure/promotion committees. All data that is retained for the purpose of the study may also be used in future research, presentations, and/or for teaching purposes by the Principal Investigator listed above. \\
Consistent with both journal/guild expectations and the ethical principles of open science, a fully anonymous and non-identifiable version of the dataset may be posted online (e.g., to the APA-endorsed ``Open Science Framework'' {[}www.osf.io{]} or to the journal, submitted with the research article). No data posted will contain any information that could identify participants in any way, either directly or indirectly. All data will be thoroughly inspected by the research prior to posting to confirm that no participant-provided responses could inadvertently identify or expose a participant. \\
Posting data (commonly referred to as ``data sharing'') is necessary for reproducibility and replicability in science, allows peer reviewers and meta-analysts to check statistical assumptions, protects the field against data fraud, and is increasingly seen as an ethical obligation within psychological science. \\

\hypertarget{regarding-data-sharing}{%
\subsection{Regarding Data Sharing}\label{regarding-data-sharing}}

Alter and Gonzalez \citeyearpar{alter_responsible_2018} recommendeded using domain-specific repositories whenever possible. Because they are more connected to the research community(ies) that will use them, they will be most likely to provide the discipline-specific curation services that will maintain the value for future reuse.

Alter and Gonzalez \citeyearpar{alter_responsible_2018} discouragde attaching research data as part of the supplementary materials associated with the publication because publishers do not manage research data with the same best practices that a data repository would. For example they may convert research data to text or pdf files and the materials may not be as discoverable as they would in a repository.

Best practices in data sharing are FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable \citep{martone_data_2018}. Check out Table 2 in the Martone et al article for the details and implications of these practices.

\hypertarget{more-resources}{%
\subsection{More Resources:}\label{more-resources}}

Alter and Gonzalez \citeyearpar{alter_responsible_2018} provided a list of resources about data sharing and open science. The resources that are websites are likely updating as the field evolves. The Open Science Framework (OSF) is one that is frequently referenced in psychology. The help pages have a section devoted to FAQs and best practices -- especially about the practical steps/logistics such as version control, file naming, and making a data dictionary: \url{https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us}

\hypertarget{and-also-preregistration}{%
\section{And also, Preregistration}\label{and-also-preregistration}}

In pre-registration, researchers describe their hypotheses, methods, and analyses before a piece of research is conducted -- in a way that can be externally verified \citep{van_t_veer_pre-registration_2016}.

This is emerging, but there are two general types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Reviewed pre-registration or registered report}: A cooperative model between reviewers and researchers that involves feedback to the research design that can be incorporated before the study is conducted. This can be accompanied by a guarantee of publication regardless of the outcome.
\item
  \textbf{Unreviewed pre-registration}: No review prior data collection. The research plan is written and time-stamped before the study. The authors can conduct research as usual.
\end{itemize}

In both, authors can still follow-up analyses with exploratory research.

Advocates of pre-registration suggest \citep{van_t_veer_pre-registration_2016}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It prioritizes theory and method over results
\item
  It distinguishes confirmatory from exploratory research
\item
  It reduces publication bias
\item
  It reduces reporting bias within a single study
\item
  It offers researchers additional input and review before they start
\item
  It can lead to faster dissemination (particularly with registered reports)
\end{itemize}

Concerns about pre-registration:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  More work? For researchers and reviewers.
\item
  Will it dampen exploration? -- van 't Veer and Giner-Sorolla \citeyearpar{van_t_veer_pre-registration_2016} have suggested that exploratory work should still be reported.
\item
  What's the value of a null literature (i.e., a bunch of studies with non-significance)?\\
  -- It can save the scientific community time and effort.
  -- It could help identify methodological problems such as being underpowered.
\item
  Idea theft -- will others steal designs?
  -- Pre-registered studies can stay private (in OSF up to 4 years) until the project is finished.
\end{itemize}

van 't Veer and Giner-Sorolla \citeyearpar{van_t_veer_pre-registration_2016} provided guidance in the form of templates/instructions for registering a study for social psychology. Let's go take a look at the OSF to see their \href{https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us}{pre-registration model}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Start with the \href{https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738794-Understand-Registration-Forms}{decision tree}
\item
  Get your \href{https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/}{form}; there's even an .rmd version!\\

Most journals now require a persistent identifier (ORCID) for researchers. These are connected to all published articles. You can obtain yours at: \url{https://orcid.org/register}

You can talk with your RVT about trying out pre-registration with lab projects.
APS (Association of Psychological Science) are a signatory to the Transparency and Open Science Guidelines (TOPS). Let's take a quick look at what that means for publishing:
\url{https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/open-science}

In participating journals, articles can be awarded badges for:
\url{https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/badges}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pre-registered
\item
  Open Data
\item
  Open Materials
\end{itemize}

As you plan your research projects, think ahead to the journals to which you might submit. See if they are part of such a process. Although it may delay your start time, if they are part of the registered reports process, you might be guaranteed submission if your pre-registration is reviewed and approved by the journal.

\section{APA Style as Epistemology (or Worse)}\label{apa-style-as-epistemology-or-worse}}

A 1995 article \citep{madigan_language_1995} in the American Psychologist compared APA style to that of other disciplines (history, literary criticism) and argued that APA Style is its own writing genre characterized by (among other things):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A story schema: introduction, method, results, discussion
  -- Seems so linear; but this is rarely the case (research is messy)
\item
  A depersonalized language of disagreement that focuses on the empirical process and away from investigators as individuals (e.g., ``The primary criticism is that the threshold-setting procedures used in previous experiments are not adequate to ensure that\ldots{}''). The goal is a collaborative, cumulative endeavor based on research data.
\item
  Hedged conclusions: balancing a need to have substantive conclusions that do not extend beyond the data. We use the words, ``tend,'' ``suggest,'' and ``may.'' See Table1.
\item
  A system of headings/subheadings (rather than narrative transitions)
\item
  Paraphrasing rather than directly quoting other works.
  -- Giving authors more flexibility in representing others' perspectives.
\item
  Multiple authors (perhaps contributing to ``more subdued prose'').
\item
  Heavy use of citations introduction and discussion so that the research is placed within an ongoing stream of empirical studies.
\item
  Language that ``does not call attention to itself.'' It can be described as: self-effacing and low-profile.
\end{itemize}

The style manual has grown from its 7-page writers guide in the Psychological Bulletin (1929) to 427 in the 7th edition (2019), today. Madigan et al. \citeyearpar{madigan_language_1995} suggests that the process of mastering APA style, one is enculturated into psychology. That is, we learn APA style -- we inculcate empiricist values (i.e., ``unarticulated practices that reflect fundamental attitudes and values of psychologists'' (p.~428). As such, APA style is epistemological.

Nearly a decade later, Thompson \citeyearpar{thompson_gentlemanly_2004} examined APA style through the lens of critical race feminism and Whiteness Theory. Thompson argued that the expectations regarding clarity precision, appropriateness, sensitivity, and objectivity likely contribute to the academy's investments in Whiteness and patriarchy. While her focus was on APA Style, she suspected that her critique would generalize to other style guides (e.g., Chicago, MLA).

Thompson's \citeyearpar{thompson_gentlemanly_2004} article focused around the gender/sexuality and race values codified by the APA manual (at the time of her article it was the 5th edition). She conducted an analysis of its \emph{power and property investments} and organized her arguments in five themes:

\textbf{Property Rights}: PWIs have treated refereed scholarship (but not indigenous or community knowledge) as intellectual property, demarcated with a certain class. That is, individuals ``own knowledge.'' Evidence includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using last names as a shorthand reference for work (e.g., ``Dik \& Duffy's 2012 CVQ'').
\item
  Tendency to cite own work rather than say, ``When I previously said\ldots{}''
\item
  The style manual indicates that principal authorship and order of authorship credit should reflect the relative contributions of persons involved (7th ed, APA 1.22) and that relative status should not determine authorship order. Thompson argued that power dynamics (especially around race and gender) likely interfere with this principle.
\item
  The 7th edition has reduced citations of articles with three and more articles to ``First author et al., YEAR'' for all citations.\\
\item
  Regarding, ownership of knowledge -- does it belong to the researcher or the community from which it came? Community knowledge can be studied but not cited. And what about institutions. What if knowledge came from the Black Church? How does one cite that?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Precedent and pedigree}: In the social sciences, we are expected to cite and give credit to relevant earlier works. Knowledge is seen as cumulative. Citations are essential.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No ``unhedged statement'' (p.~45) is made without a citation; and in introductory sections, citations are often included with claims that seem obvious! This establishes the requisite lineage.
\item
  Self-citations, expected citations (of the gurus), citations of colleagues exist IN TENSION with a citation economy (page limits, afterall).
\item
  The requirement that scholars locate their project in the context of the existing peer-reviewed literature serves to keep out ideas/projects that would be challenging to the existing power structure.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proceduralism}: APA authors learn to address an audience unmarked (as if they were white, male, heterosexual) by gender or race as a ``sign of professionalism'' (p.~48).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Standardized Format: a four section structure: Introduction, Method, Results Discussion; it could be that the experiences of marginalized and oppressed groups cannot be captured by this scientific narrative structure.
\item
  Standardized Style: prizing scientific appearance and elegance. Thompson (2004) follows the guidelines regarding the use of the ``slash'' (/) and how it is impossible to standardize to the degree that it works for all groups.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The ``First author et al., (year)'' citation contributes to both gender- and color-blindness. ON the one hand is it ``fair.'' On the other hand, it obscures the person of the author.
  \item
    APA's prohibition against footnotes minimizes ``the good stuff'' (the most juicy arguments are always in the footnotes).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Protocol}: Propriety or protocol represents conduct that signifies one's understanding of prevailing relations of power, authority and legitimacy.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The style manual (7th ed, Chapter 5, e.g., 5.2) acknowledges the importance of sensitivity and the avoidance of pejoratives to reference groups of people. Thompson indicates that this is ``admirable'' it fails to address unequal power relations. Further, distinctions between what is insensitive and pejorative may be invisible to those in positions of privilege.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The gentleman's agreement}: APA style is characterized ``language that conveys professionalism and formality'' (7th ed, 4.7, 4.8) and ``differences should be presented in a professional and noncombative manner'' (7th ed, 4.7).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Thompson \citeyearpar{thompson_gentlemanly_2004} is concerned that while this is offered with the hope of pluralism and the creation of safe spaces, it causes controversies to be ignored or dismissed and may bolster complicity in racism.

\section{The JARS: The Core of APA Style}\label{the-jars-the-core-of-apa-style}}

The JARS {[}Journal Article Reporting Standards; \citet{appelbaum_journal_2018}{]} were first introduced in a 2008 feature in the American Psychologist \citep{noauthor_reporting_2008} and were included in the 6th edition of the style manual. The updated JARS, published in 2018, expanded the types of quantitative research (JARS-Quant) and included standards for reporting qualitative (JARS-Qual) and mixed methods (JARS-Mixed). Chapter 3 of the 7th edition is devoted to JARS. It contains numerous tables, definitions/explanations, and a flowchart.

The JARS are an attempt to represent what is common across approaches. There is a recognition that specialties/sub-specialties use different terminology. The terms, therefore, should be treated as placeholders and be updated to reflect the various research traditions.

In each of the sections below, I list both the APA style recommendations and JARS elements -- which are somewhat annoyingly separate, adjacent, and overlapping.

In the next section I used text-citations to also refer to the section numbers of the 7th edition of the APA style manual. Additionally, because this OER is publicly available (i.e., not just used in my classroom), I have not copied the JARS elements into this document. They are freely available \href{https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quantitative}{here}

\hypertarget{headings-apa-2.7}{%
\subsection{Headings (APA 2.7)}\label{headings-apa-2.7}}

The 7th edition of the style manual updated the levels of headings. The change is to the L3 heading -- making it a little easier for Word processing programs.

There are now 5 levels of headings. A useful table that illustrates them can be found \href{https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/headings}{here}.

Headings follow a top-down progression.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each section (i.e., Title {[}on first page{]}, Method, Results, Discussion) starts with an L2 heading.
\item
  Do not include an ``Introduction'' heading -- the first paragraphs of a paper are automatically expected to be introductory in nature.
  Here's the heading structure in the paper (a ``brief report'') we are investigating:
\end{itemize}

\textbf{You Speak English Well! Asian American's Reactions to an Exceptionalizing Stereotype Microaggressions Against Asian Americans} (L1, centered, bold, title case)

\textbf{Method} (L1, centered, bold, title case)

\textbf{Sample} (L2, flush left, bold, title case)
\textbf{Procedure and Materials} (L2, flush left, bold, title case)
\textbf{Analysis and Manipulation Check} (L2, flush left, bold, title case)

\textbf{Results} (L1, centered, bold, title case)

\textbf{Discussion} (L1, centered, bold, title case)

\textbf{Conclusion} (L1, centered, bold, title case)

\hypertarget{reference-list}{%
\subsection{Reference List}\label{reference-list}}

The reference list should start on a new page with ``References'' in bold and centered (an L1 heading -- like the title).

The general format of the reference is: Author (Date). Title. Source. The 7th edition has made significant improvements in making this format consistent throughout the many types of references. Plus, Chapter 9 in the 7th edition has a number of tools for problematic reference entries.

One substantial change in the 7th edition is the immediate use of ``et al.'' after the first author's name there are three or more authors. In contrast, up to 20 authors can be included in the entry in the reference list.

Use a hanging indent and format this with the paragraph-formatting function of your word processor's ruler. This means that the first line of each reference is flush left and subsequent lines are indented by 0.5 inches:

The text-citations and reference lists must be 100\% consistent. If you have consistently (and properly) used your reference management system, this will happen by magic. Even so, one of the last things I do is a text-ref/ref-list cross check. I open 2 copies of the manuscript and put them side-by-side on the monitor. Starting with the text (and in track changes), each time I come to a reference, I put an X in front of it on the ref list. I go through the entire document. If there are items in the ref list missing, I note it (then add it). If there are additional references in the ref list that I haven't checked, I do a quick search to see if they are really missing, and if so, I delete them. For dissertation proposals and defenses, we ask first and second year students to do this for us -- it familiarizes them with RVT topics, the dissertation process, and the literature.

Because of Zotero, Mendeley, RefWorks, EndNote, and other reference management systems (as well as the good tools in the style manual), I won't say more about text-citations and reference lists.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Stylistic Issues (APA Chapter 4 on \emph{Writing Style and Grammar})}{Stylistic Issues (APA Chapter 4 on Writing Style and Grammar)}}\label{stylistic-issues-apa-chapter-4-on-writing-style-and-grammar}}

APA (4.0) is committed to a literary style characterized by continuity (logical consistency of expression throughout a written work), flow (smooth cadence of words and sentences), conciseness (say only what you need to say), and clarity. I encourage the authors to read Chapter 4 of the style manual for examples of how to increase the effectiveness with which they write.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Transitional words between sentences and phrases (or sentences) between paragraphs and sections assist with continuity and flow
  -- Time: then, next, after, while, since
  -- Cause-effect: therefore, consequently, as a result
  -- Addition links: in addition, moreover, furthermore, similarly
  -- Contrast links: but, conversely, nevertheless, however, although
  -- Think twice about using adverbs (certainly, consequently, importantly, interestingly) as transition words.
\item
  Active headings/subheadings contribute to continuity and flow.
\item
  Don't add any more words than necessary. Say \emph{only} what needs to be said:
  -- No ``fluff'' (avoid: very, really)
  -- Maintain a professional tone (avoid cliché's, rhymes, alliteration, metaphors, slang -- remember a global audience)
\item
  Clarity is improved with a varied sentence length; long sentences can be confusing.
\item
  APA style permits both active (subject, verb, object: ``students completed surveys) and passive (object of verb is presented first: ``surveys were completed by students'') voice. The active voice contributes to direct, clear, and concise statements.
\end{itemize}

More style-congruent advice:
* Avoid abstract stacking.
* Avoid organizing by an author(s)' name(s).
-- Organize by ideas -- Unless it is important, citations should be at the end of a sentence. Ask yourself why you are starting a sentence with an author's name -- Is he or she the point of your sentence? Could be but most likely not.
* Use quotations sparingly: short ones, infrequently.
* Precision, continuity, clarity, efficiency (stop with the long sentences)
* Active voice (``It'' is banned as first word in paragraphs and sentences).
* Manuscript must be written in first person.
-- Avoid this: ``Hypotheses for the present study included\ldots{}''
-- Do this instead: ``In our study, we hypothesized\ldots{}''
* Past tense or present perfect tense for the literature review, method, and results sections; present tense for the discussion section.

\subsection{Reducing Bias (APA Chapter 5)}\label{reducing-bias-apa-chapter-5}}

Chapter 5, ``Bias-Free Language Guidelines'' is new to the 7th edition. A big message is that this is-and-will-continue-to-be-evolving.

Here are some of the highlights

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe relevant characteristics; it is likely unnecessary to collect and/or report on all personal characteristics for the topic being explored.
\item
  Don't shy away/hide/gloss over actual differences in the target population from the general population. Describe them clearly and professionally.
\item
  There are specific guidelines for level of specificity in labels/language for various topics (e.g., disability, age, gender identity, race/ethnicity/nationality, sexual orientation, SES). Look them up.
\item
  A few guiding principles (but there are so many more\ldots read the chapter):
  -- Call people what they call themselves (especially in qualitative or participant-informed research designs). Also recognize that no group is monolithic so there may be within-group differences about this.
  -- Accept that language changes with time -- stay open minded.
  -- There is debate about person-first language (``a child with autism'') and identity-first language (``an autistic child''). Get consultation and listen to the research participants.
  -- ``White,'' ``cis-gendered,'' ``heterosexual,'' and ``U.S.'' is often the standard against which others are judged. This centers Whiteness. Avoid these false hierarchies. When these comparisons are made, placing the socially dominant group on the left side of a graph or at the top of a table may imply these groups are the universal standard.
\end{itemize}

A (very) few specific details:
* On identification of race:
-- ``African American'' is discouraged as an umbrella term for people of African ancestry worldwide because it obscures other ethnicities or national origins (e.g, Jamaica). In these cases use Black (with a capital ``B'').
-- ``Caucasian'' is discouraged as an umbrella term for White or European because it originated as a way of classifying White people as a superior race. Use White (with a capital ``W'').
-- ``Native American'' and ``Native North American'' seem to be preferred in North America.
-- ``Latin@'' is now widely accepted for Latino and Latina; as is ``Latino/a.'' ``Latinx'' can also be used as a gender-neutral or nonbinary term inclusive of all genders.\\
* Avoid writing about ``minorities.'' Terms like ``people of color'' or ``underrepresented groups'' are preferred. Do not assume that members of any of these groups are ``underprivileged.'' Terms like ``economically marginalized'' or ``economically exploited'' may be preferred.
* Use ``sexual orientation'' not ``sexual preference,'' ``sexual identity,'' or ``sexual orientation identity.'' The term ``sexual and gender minorities'' refers to multiple sexual and/or gender minority groups or write about ``sexual orientation and gender diversity.''\\
-- LGBT is considered outdated, but LGBTQ, LGBTQ+, LGBTQIA, AND LGBTQIA+ may be used to refer to multiple groups (but be careful and specific; if you are researching transgender people\ldots then talk about transgender people).
* ``They'' is now acceptable to use in the singular. There are a number of circumstances when this is recommended. A few include:
-- When it is the person's preferred pronoun.
-- When the pronoun is unknown.
-- In place of ``he or she,'' ``s/he,'' and ``(s)he.''

In the past -- I discouraged the use of reference management programs (e.g., EndNote, RefWorks) because they often made mistakes and it was easy to spot papers where they had been used (because of the errors). I was introduced to Zotero when I sought to create a bibliography in Rmarkdown. Then I learned it could be used in Word. Even after submitting two articles for publication, I have yet to find it make an error(that is, when each reference has been correctly entered {[}only once{]} in Zotero). Thus -- I'm a fan. Count me in!

This lecturette demonstrates the use of Zotero in the context of the APA style paper. I have a separate lecturette (in an .rmd file) for using Zotero in R. This quick introduction includes a Zotero demonstration for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  acquiring references
\item
  text references
\item
  creating a reference list
\item
  for use as your own personal library
\item
  with the potential for collaboration

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    admittedly, I have not yet tried collaboraiton (stay tuned)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Reference management systems include resources like RefWorks, Endnote, Mendeley, and Citationsy. Microsoft Word even has its own process.

  Recognizing the ways that a reference management system will contribute to the efficiency (and quality) of a research project
\item
  Saving references (including full text copies of publications) in the Zotero system

\hypertarget{grabbing-storing-pubs}{%
\section{Grabbing \& Storing Pubs}\label{grabbing-storing-pubs}}

Whether it's through the library search engine, PsychInfo (or similar), or something you have found on a website, Zotero will grab either a snapshot of the website (so you can get back to it) or the full-text article and store it for you. To do this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open Zotero

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is even easier if, in Zoter, you have opened the file folder of the desired destination. If not, you can simply drag-and-drop entries into the desired folder(s).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In your browser, user the Zotero Connector to navigate to t he closest you can get to full-text.
\item
  Click the Zotero icon in your browser.
\item
  Heading to Zotero, check to see what was cpatured.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the ull-text is missing, either try again (from a different place on the web), or
\item
  Download the full-text and attach it separately by right-clicking on the entry and selecting ``add attachment.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Double-check the ``info'' (in the far right column of your Zotero app) that was captured. Edit any errors (this will save you time later).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zotero captures ormal library items fairly well. It struggles more when you grab an item from a webpage.
\item
  Sometimes Zotero cannot discern the ``Item Type.'' This can be problematic because it provides the wrong fields. You can change the item type by changing the selection in the top item in the bibliographic information.
\end{itemize}

To insert a citation, simply select, ``Add/Edit'' citation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Select the style you wish -- APA 7th edition was available very shortly after the introduction of the 7th ed! You have a choice of single-spaced or double-spaced.
\item
  Then simply type in any word on which you want Zotero to search your library (e.g., author name, partial title). Zotero will produce a list of items that match the criteria. Simply select it.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Zotero will follow the 7th edition rules, shortening any citation that has 3 more authors to ``et al.'' for all citations.
    \_ Zotero will automatically order citations alphabetically and/or by year of entry. AND, it will add the ``a,'' ``b,'' and ``c'' designations for identical pubs.
  \item
    If there are errors, simply return to the Zotero entry, fix it, and then ``Refresh'' (on the Zotero tab) and it should auto-correct.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item
  It is possible to collaborate in Zotero. I can export the library to be imported by a collaborator and they should have ``all the things.'' I'm not an expert in this and I think there is even more potential for this (but I'm still learning).
\item
  I can export the Zotero libraries as a ``BibTeX'' that can be used in my .rmd files where I can similarly do text citations and ref lists.

Fluency with the skills in this lecturette will be essential as you format tables for papers, journal articles, posters, and your dissertation.

In high school and college the method for writing \emph{term papers} involved taking notes on index cards (note on front, citation on back), sorting them into sections of the paper, sorting each section into its proper order, and writing it up.

Some years ago, I adapted that process to Excel. Getting some positive feedback or it, I wrote up a lecture on it. Even with improved reference management systems (like Excel) and R programs like \emph{papaja} (for writing APA style manuscripts), I continue to use Excel for notetaking and organizing my thoughts. As you will see in this lesson, it also helps me separate the ``plaigarized'' material so that I do not unintentionally use it.

Although the Excel spreadsheet is easy to create, the template I use in the lecture is in the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_Topics}{Github book site}.

\section{Where to Start}\label{where-to-start}}

\hypertarget{bottom-up}{%
\subsection{Bottom Up}\label{bottom-up}}

Starting from the bottom up means identifying the primary variables in my study and begin researching each of them. I start ``bottom up'' when:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I know the general topics that I want to investigate,
\item
  but I don't know the literature well (or as well as I'd like),
\item
  and I need to develop a strong narrative thread
\end{itemize}

For example, if I know I want to explore the relations between the following variables, I will begin with a ``bottom up'' approach,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Archiving information about each construct
\item
  Documenting the ways that the variables relate to each other
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\caption{Screenshot of bubbles representing the three variables: vocational identity, psychological well-being, and calling}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{top-down}{%
\subsection{Top Down}\label{top-down}}

Starting from the top down occurs when I know the precise model I want to investigate and the relations I'm predicting. I will frequently draw the model so that I can keep it in front of me as I am researching and writing

For example, if I am going to write a research proposal testing the following model, I will likely begin with top down approach.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Excel/TopDown2.png}
\caption{Screenshot of a moderated mediation involving the variables search and presence of calling, vocational identity, and psychological well-being}
\end{figure}

After the introductory paragraph(s), my paper will focus on the importance of the DV, psychological wellbeing.

Building backwards, I would then talk about the relationship between vocational identity and psychological well-being.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Vocational identity contributes to psychological well-being in college students
\item
  The effects of calling on these variables are not well understood
  -Positive effects have been documented

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There may be a dark side to calling -- for those who seek and do not find
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Therefore, the purpose of our study is to investigate the mediating role of vocational identity on the relation between search for calling and psychological well-being.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Within this model, we propose that presence of calling moderates the relation between search for calling, such that, those who search for calling and find it, have stronger vocational identity, and, in turn, higher psychological well-being.
\item
  And, those who search for calling but do not find it, have lower vocational identity, and lower psychological well-being.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mostly-i-start-in-the-middle}{%
\subsection{Mostly I Start in the Middle}\label{mostly-i-start-in-the-middle}}

That is, I often know that the variables I"m interested in relate to each other, but I want to use the literature to further solidify the paths I will specify in my research mode.

I use Excel to organize my notes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In empirical papers for introduction and discussion (not method or results)
\item
  For qualitative results
\item
  For book chapters, literature review, theoretical papers
\end{itemize}

There are numerous benefits to this approach. I believe that it:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Facilitates group writing
\item
  Creates an archive/cannon/library of our most used resources
\item
  Clearly identifies plagiarized material and allows us to understand how/where we have integrated and adapted the material
\item
  Makes tracking primary and secondary references \emph{so much easier}
\item
  Easy to order/re-order through revisions
\end{itemize}

The process of writing in Excel includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note-taking from primary sources to include
  -- Direct copy plagiarized material from the source
  -- Taking notes on why we wanted it
  -- Proper reference documentation at first use
\item
  Iteratively working on the outline
\item
  Refining categories/sections/headings
\item
  Ordering the notes
\item
  Writing the first drafts of the ms DIRECTLY into excel
  *Transferring to the word processing software
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Structure of my Spreadsheet}\label{the-structure-of-my-spreadsheet}}

Below is a screenshot of how I set up the worksheets in my spreadsheet.

\end{figure}

Instructions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Co-authors leave each other notes on the game-plan
\end{itemize}

Outline

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Developing the outline is iterative/dynamic and, especially when beginning from \emph{bottom up} or \emph{somewhere in the middle}, is updated and revised frequently
\end{itemize}

\caption{Screenshot of the structure of my Outline worksheet}
\end{figure}

Tabs for each Section

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Correspond with outline numbers
\item
  Contain the following columns
  -- Order
  -- Categories
  -- Writing for ms
  -- Plagiarized copy
  -- Notes
  -- First cite
  -- Subsequent cites
  -- Full citation
  -- Page(s)
  -- By
\end{itemize}

References

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Near the end of the project, assemble a full reference list
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{lets-tour}{%
\section{Let's Tour}\label{lets-tour}}

The first tour is quick and hypothetical. In it, I transer the written document from Excel to Word (this is the \emph{supplement} reerred to in the screencast).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open up a new/blank word document (one for each worksheet of material).
\item
  Click on the ``Mailings'' tab and select
\item
  ``Start Mail Merge'' and (optionally) ``Step by step mail merge wizard''
\item
  Select ``Directory'' THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL STEP
\item
  ``Select Recipients.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Use ``Browse'' to locate the spreadsheet (if the spreadsheet is on a SP {[}or other cloud{]} folder and you can't select it from a networked drive, you may first need to download it to your computer).
  \item
    In Word, select the worksheet whose data you want to import. It should be sorted properly (first).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Click ``Edit Recipient List.'' You may wish to turn ``off'' the 999s.
\item
  Select ``Insert Merge Field.'' I chose, ``Writing for ms.'' I added 2 spaces after the element.
\item
  Select ``Finish \& Merge.''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``Edit individual documents''
  \item
    ``All''
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The text will be organized as one big paragraph, will likely need formatting updates, and may have spelling errors (that you didn't make.).

At present, I only know how to merge 1 worksheet at a time into separate documents (then those should be copied together).

\end{figure}

The second tour includes a series of screencasts that are authentically a new project from the very first step. The RVT (and I, separately) have several projects coming that involved calling/vocation. I've dabbled in the calling literature, but don't know it thoroughly. I'm using the spreadsheets to begin to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Capture the info
\item
  Organize it in my head (and in excel worksheets)
\item
  And then craft it into arguments for a handful of empirical manuscripts
  These screencasts will document that process from start, to, I hope a published manuscript (or at least one that's submitted.
\end{itemize}

Ideas included

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Starting with the empty excel spreadsheet
\item
  Assuming \emph{no knowledge} (or very little) of the literature, therefore
  -- Categories are broad and non-directional; just capturing info
  -- A priori, I can guess I want categories of: definitions, outcomes, measures, norms
\item
  These won't all make it into papers; I'm just getting my footing
\item
  Reviewing the literature/marking-it-up before notetaking
\item
  Research team members often keep common ``Reading Room'' folders in the cloud
\item
  As soon as I get my footing, I can assign some of these articles to team members who can also collect the data into the spreadsheets.
\end{itemize}

**8 months, 1 presentation, 2 white papers, and 1 journal article later\ldots{}

What worked well:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One core spreadsheet gave was the source for 4 projects

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We learned to ``save as'' a copy of the original raw notes because those ``gross groupings'' were a fantastic well for substantial revisions and related projects
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When we received editorial feedback and I thought it would be a ``quick revision,'' I still found it easier to return to the spreadsheets, supplement-and-reorder my notes, write in excel and transfer back into word.
\end{itemize}

What didn't go as well:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Likely because of the deadlines, the substantial requests for revision, and a full year, I didn't use the team as much as I would have liked
\item
  We didn't follow ``all the rules''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Didn't capture a lot of page \#s
  \item
    Didn't have detailed outlines (or update outlines with revisions)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Would I do it again? Some years later -- yes, I still write in Excel (even with the presence of other tools like Zotero).

\hypertarget{faqs}{%
\section{FAQs}\label{faqs}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  (For students in our doctoral program) Am I required to Write in Excel for my mentored research project (MRP)?
  -- YES, if you are in the Bikos RVT.
  -- NO, if you are anyone else.
\item
  What's the difference between Editing in Excel Online and Editing in Full Excel.
  -- Excel ONLINE allows multiple editors at once, BUT

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You have to be working on different worksheets
  \item
    You don't have some of the full benefits of excel (I find it difficult to sort and so some other functions that I really like))
  \item
    You don't need to hit SAVE. Everything you type is automatically saved. So be careful, we've unintentionally deleted stuff and didn't realize it. OUCH.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Using the full EXCEL package gives you full EXCEL functionality, there are nuances:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If one person is working in full excel, it locks everyone out from everything except viewing. That is, no one else can work IN ANY CAPACITY on the document at the same time.
  \item
    It looks like you've ``downloaded'' it, but you have not. When you hit SAVE, it saves back to SP. If you intentionally or unintentionally disconnect from Internet, it updates once you are reconnected.
  \item
    You must hit SAVE in order for your changes to be saved.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I prefer to work in full Excel and it's only rarely a problem that teammates have my same schedule and want to work at the same time. When they do, we just coordinate.
